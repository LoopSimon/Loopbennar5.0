 raithtall_golden_memory_title:0 "The Golden Memory"
 raithtall_golden_memory_desc:0 "The Acres may be ash, but the flames still burn us."\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nIt's been several years since the sack of Dorcurt. Ten years since the Golden Acres burned. Ten years since the Iadthi Peitar slaughtered our people. Ten years since the Autumn Court was cowardly ambushed on the cusp of their greatest triumph. What remains of the Tuathak are scattered princedoms squabbling over leadership that they bear no right to. A new generation is growing up, that has never seen the light of the Golden Acres, that has never known the lost unity of Autumn. In time, it seems the memory of Dorcurt is destined to slip away into distant history, like the Precursor Empire before it.\n\nNo.\n\nDorcurt is not an ancient myth or a romantic legend. Dorcurt was our lives and our home, and we will fight to reclaim it. The others may have forgotten, but in Raithtall, the Golden Memory of Dorcurt is still worth fighting for!"
 raithtall_court_anew_title:0 "The Court Anew"
 raithtall_court_anew_desc:0 ""Rise, spires of Dorcurt! And may you never fall again!"\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nDorcurt is ours again! On a day that will be celebrated every year hence across the Autumn Court, we have retaken our stolen heart from those who defiled it, but its vigor has not yet returned. After vandalizing the city of Dorcurt and butchering its inhabitants, the Iadthi repopulated it with their own people, as well as those conquered Tuathak whom they hadn't put to the sword or thrown onto pyres. Yet still many parts of the city are damaged, and our reconquest did sadly not help matters. We should put the ones who destroyed Dorcurt to work on rebuilding it. That way, they may atone for but a smidgen of their crimes, and see firsthand the suffering and destruction brought by their so-called "balance"."
 raithtall_gate_stewards_title:0 "Stewards of the Gate"
 raithtall_gate_stewards_desc:0 "The unforeseen incursion of a massive Peitar host right at the doorstep of Dorcurt heralded the greatest disaster in the history of the Autumn Court. We must ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again. Unfortunately, this can only be accomplished if the Fey Lords agree to transfer the title of Gate Steward from the Iadthi Peitar to us. Thankfully, the seizure of the Iadthi riches has ended up giving us exactly what we need to make the Fey Lords hear our proposal out…"
 raithtall_twilight_oath_title:0 "The Twilight Oath"
 raithtall_twilight_oath_desc:0 ""The Oath remains as true as a millennium ago, merely needing someone worthy to speak the words…"\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nWe have restored all the lands and cities of Dorcurt, yet without the Oath, they are merely land and buildings. Contact the Gloam Knight! Let him know that the nightmare is over, that we never strayed from our loyalty, and that the true heir is ready to recite the Twilight Oath anew!"
 raithtall_securing_copperlord_title:0 "Fealty of the Forge"
 raithtall_securing_copperlord_desc:0 "As the biggest copper mine in western Eordand, Sglard has always been crucial to the power of Dorcurt. We need to bring them into our fold, and ensure that both their loyalty and their copper production are as strong as ever before!"
 raithtall_example_of_eighard_title:0 "An Example of Eighard"
 raithtall_example_of_eighard_desc:0 "Everyone knows that Dorcurt is the only true leader of the Autumn Court, or at least everyone sensible does. Sadly, the rulers of Eighard, with the wicked Cult of Rot whispering into their ears, are far from sensible, and tried to claim leadership over the Hibernal Crusaders even before the fall of Dorcurt. That such a great bastion of Autumn as Darblath would fall to the Rotting heresy is tragic enough, but for the heresy to then claim dominion over the true Autumn worship is completely unacceptable! The Esbaggs of Eighard will learn their place, and the abominable Rot that has befallen them will be cleansed for good!"
 raithtall_replant_acres_title:0 "Replant the Acres"
 raithtall_replant_acres_desc:0 "'I was but a child when Dorcurt fell, when the flames of the Peitar took my family. I ran as fast as my short legs could carry, and hid as well as my tiny body could. With my family gone I had to live as a beggar, until a farm was willing to take me in. Yet the accursed flames had not stopped. We could only watch in horror as the arsonists, not content with merely burning our city and its people, set their sights on the Golden Acres themselves! The pride of our people, the affirmation of our faith, just…gone. Forever…\n\nEver since, my life has been hollow, my world a bleak shadow of what was meant to be. So when I saw that newly sprouted sapling, those first fiery leaves shining defiantly orange in the middle of winter, I knew what it signified. I fell on my knees, tears streaming out of my eyes that had so long forgotten even how to weep. They are not just memories, the world that my family lived in has returned. When recalling their faces I no longer see a destroyed past, but a shining future!'"
 raithtall_discipline_arakeprun_title:0 "Discipline Arakeprun"
 raithtall_discipline_arakeprun_desc:0 "Arakeprun had long fought with Dorcurt over the Tasmet borderlands, and with the Iadthi attack they finally saw their chance, even striking a deal with the interlopers to concede the province. Preposterous! Such incompetents who can't even handle a simple noble uprising in Elchos clearly aren't fit to rule even the tiniest piece of Dorcurt! It is time to finally teach the Arakepruni a lesson, loyalists and upstarts both."
 raithtall_example_of_einnsag_title:0 "An Example of Einnsag"
 raithtall_example_of_einnsag_desc:0 "The decadent lords and merchants of Einnsag have long dominated the seas of Autumn with both their mighty fleet and their desirable gems. Once Dorcurt fell, they were quick to declare themselves the new rulers of Autumn. Unacceptable! We must demonstrate that the right to lead comes not from luxuries and shiny baubles, but from loyal servitude. Einnsag needs to be dealt with decisively and the trade of their corrupting gems shut down for good."
 raithtall_reunite_crusaders_title:0 "Reunite the Crusaders"
 raithtall_reunite_crusaders_desc:0 ""Gather your lost children, remind them of their purpose."\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nAt Dorcurt's call, the champions of Autumn marched onto the very heart of Winter, founding the new kingdoms of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal. Yet their triumph was halted, as the rise of Gemradcurt's wicked witch-queen forced the brave crusaders to retreat. The ever presumptuous Esbagg of Eighard declared himself overlord of the Crusade and demanded the other crusader dukads gather and swear fealty to him at Minnorac. Their attempt would be interrupted by an ambush from Strutmar, decapitating the leadership of the crusades. Attempting to restore order, Ladrana Emberborn called all the leaders of Autumn to Dorcurt to reorganize the crusades. This summit would tragically echo what happened at Minnorac as the cowardly Peitar struck once again, this time directly from the Domandrod itself. As the true successor of Dorcurt, it is our duty to reunite the crusaders under our banner, and destroy Strutmar so that no further treachery can occur."
 raithtall_resume_crusades_title:0 "Resume the Crusades"
 raithtall_resume_crusades_desc:0 "The marriage between Dharastor III and Erlass Whitehand brought a new perspective on the Snecboth to Raithtall. The new queen insisted that her people didn't worship Winter out of malice, but as a way to survive and care for each other during the harsh cold. While this brings hope that the Snecboth may one day be shown the protective and charitable ways of Autumn, ultimately our government is in agreement that the season of death must never be bolstered, no matter the reason. The Hibernal Crusades were orchestrated by Dorcurt to end Winter worship, but were undercut by the attacks of Iadth and Strutmar. As Dorcurt's successors, it falls upon us to pick up the task once again, and resume the Hibernal Crusades."
 raithtall_break_oath_title:0 "Break Their Oath"
 raithtall_break_oath_desc:0 "Has there ever been a viler oath sworn than that of Pelodan I? At the dawn of Eordand, when our ancestors returned from the Domandrod, they discovered a world of powerful seasons. Some were inspired by the rebirth of Spring, some embraced the warmth of Summer, and others looked to Autumn to protect them from the darkness of Winter. Pelodan was outraged by these new practices, and swore to enforce the old ways on all of Eordand, no matter what: no matter how many forests were burned, no matter how many cities were razed, no matter how many children were impaled. And his fanatic followers have terrorized the free peoples of Eordand for every century since.\n\nBring them down. Crush their walls. Melt their weapons. Execute their tyrant-king to a roaring applause. The Eordellon Crusades end here and now."
 raithtall_vernal_harmony_title:0 "Vernal Harmony"
 raithtall_vernal_harmony_desc:0 "Arakeprun split apart because of the conflict between its druids and its nobles. Even now that we have brought their nation to heel, the bickering still persists among them. The contrast with our peaceful Twilight Court, where the monarchists and theocrats coexist in harmony with each other, couldn't be more pronounced. We need to fold the bickering elites of Arakeprun into this harmony, and show the Selpheregi how true leadership works."
 raithtall_autumn_invincible_title:0 "Autumn Invincible"
 raithtall_autumn_invincible_desc:0 "Once, the Autumn Court was broken and leaderless, crushed by the cowardly assaults of Iadth and Strutmar. Its capital lay in ruins, and its heartland had burnt to ash. But look at us now! The Autumn Court is reunited, in harmony, stronger than ever. There is no other force on Eordand that can challenge the might of Autumn!"
 raithtall_winter_defied_title:0 "Winter Defied"
 raithtall_winter_defied_desc:0 ""The impossible goal, finally reached."\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nWith the fall of Gemradcurt and their witch queen the strength of the Winter Court is finally broken. The bastion of darkness that we've fought off for so long is no more, a victory that will be sung about for centuries. All that is left is to claim the prize."
 raithtall_release_prisoners_title:0 "Release the Prisoners"
 raithtall_release_prisoners_desc:0 "The dungeons of the Seasons Unchanging Inquisition is a grim place. The Oathsworn spread their doctrine by force, but not even following their Eordellon doctrine was enough to spare outsiders from their torment. The Peitar believe that all confessions of faith from the non-Peitar are inherently untrustworthy, as the Tuathak, Selpheregi, Caamas, and Snecboth all have their seasonal heresies etched into the very colors of their skin. Hence the Seasons Unchanging Inquisition. It is tasked with the capture of any non-Peitar they suspect of heresy, and then the torture-aided acquisition of dubious confessions that only serve to raise the Peitar's suspicions of other Eordan even further.\n\nThis disgusting institution must be dismantled as soon as possible! The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has ordered the immediate release of all the Inquisition's prisoners, barring only some bureaucratic preparations like acquiring housing for those who need it, finding confiscated possessions, and ensuring that none of them have been jailed for any actual crimes."
 raithtall_true_chivalry_title:0 "True Chivalry"
 raithtall_true_chivalry_desc:0 "It pains us to admit it, but among all the Eordan peoples, the Peitar are our closest kin. Their reverence for oaths, strict loyalty, militant fervor all closely resemble the honor of the Tuathak. With the people of Eordand finally freed from the millennium-long nightmare of the Eordellon Crusades, perhaps we could teach them what true chivalry looks like!"
 raithtall_new_praisegranting_title:0 "The New Praisegranting"
 raithtall_new_praisegranting_desc:0 ""Once protectors of Autumn, now protectors of Eordand."\n-"The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf\n\nThe Praisegranting festival is the most cherished of Tuathak traditions, where vassals and allies show their loyalty through bestowment of gifts and honors. While an important part of keeping our relations with our Tuathak subordinates, the expansion of our realm has won us many foreign subjects who stand outside this ritual. We should expand the Praisegranting festival, inviting not just the Tuathak, so that it may bring all the Eordan together!"
 raithtall_emberborns_ambition_title:0 "Emberborn's Ambition"
 raithtall_emberborns_ambition_desc:0 "Ladrana Emberborn was meant to be the greatest hero of the Tuathak. She was the one who united the Autumn Court in a common cause, to vanquish the darkness of Winter once and for all. Yet history took another turn. Jealous of her glory, the Peitar organised an attack directly from the Domandrod, something that had never been seen before in the history of Eordand. Caught unaware by a possibility she hadn't even known of, Ladrana was captured at a summit with the other Tuathak leaders, all of which were tied and forced to watch as the people of Dorcurt were massacred and the Golden Acres were burned down.\n\nLadrana is gone, unjustly murdered as everything she had lived for fell apart around her, yet the justice she fought for still lives on. We have carried her torch, and removed the stain of Winter Worship from the Snecboth once and for all. The sun now shines on a peaceful and harmonic Randrunnse, the way that Ladrana Emberborn would have wished it to."
 raithtall_golden_dream_title:0 "The Golden Dream"
 raithtall_golden_dream_desc:0 ""If you defy the cage of history. If you refuse to let memories fade. If you believe our hopes can shape the world. Then dream with me, the golden dream."\n-Intro to "The Golden Dream", by Ardoran Copperleaf, an alternate history novel from 1787, written five years after the Hierarchy's invasion of northern Eordand and the dissolution of Raithtall, following the ascendance of Einnsag.\nHe would never see the reborn Dorcurt he wished for, but isn't it sweet to dream?"

The Caamasi also tell us of merchants from far to the south. What has arrived this day is not an ordinary occurrence: a massive wooden ship bedecked in gleaming iron guns sailed into our harbor, making inquiries about our lands and our peoples. Doubtless impressed by our might, they wish to stay in our lands for some time. This occasion warrants a reaction: let us prepare for a Praisegranting!"

 flavor_raithtall.1.t:0 "Audience with the Fey"
 flavor_raithtall.1.d:0 "The caravan stops outside the Orachran gate, right at the very edge of the Domandrod. Each wagon is carrying a large wooden chest. From the other side of the gate emerges a second entourage, this one made up of fey creatures in both elven and non-elven forms. The parties have arrived at just the time agreed by the ambassadors.\n\n‘You know why we are here, [Root.Monarch.GetName] declares, we wish to appeal for the [GetRaithtallAllRulerTitles] to be made Protector[GetRaithtallRulersPlural] of the Autumn Ward!'\n\n‘We told you that the greed and impropriety of such a demand was unbefitting of your exalted position', replies the speaker of the fey, a tall and dark figure with grand tree branches rising like antrers from its head. ‘Yet you claimed you would be able to show us proof why this was the wisest course of action.'\n\nAt the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s signal, the first and largest of the chests is brought forth. ‘These', says [Root.Monarch.GetName], opening the chest, ‘were all found in the palace of the Sonad of Iadth!'\n\nWood, dyes and fruits taken from Domandrod plants. Meats, horns and furs from Domandrod animals. The entire chest is full of sacred goods, blasphemously poached directly from the Domandrod. One by one, each chest is brought forward and opened. There is a chest for almost every single Iadthi noble family. As they go through the chests, the blasphemies within become more obscene. An alseid gags in revulsion at a chest containing alseid pelts. A treant shakes in fury at a chest containing treant wood furniture. [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] shaking as well. So many trees burned, so many innocents killed, all for their "balance", and this is what they truly thought of the fey?\n\nWhen all the chests have been opened, everyone is silent. The large antlered fey, has remained expressionless for the entire time.\n\n‘We accept your request.', the fey finally speaks. ‘You will be named the new Protectors of the Autumn Ward, and the nation, titles and very name of Iadth will be forever forbidden by decree of the Fey Lords. We demand only one thing in return.'"

The great poaching scandal proves the need for further garrisons and patrols inside the Domandrod as well. This will also stop any future surprise attacks like the one which originally destroyed Dorcurt. The Peitar Gladewardens who live inside the Domandrod will have to learn to live alongside our Gate Guardians. We do not lack volunteers eager to see the sacred Domandrod with their own eyes. Most of all, they long to see Fogarglac, the Autumn Glade. It is said that the trees of Fogarglac are just like the lost Golden Acres, enchanted by the same Autumnal magic. Perhaps, if we could study these trees, or even be allowed some seeds by the Fey Lords, we could one day replant that which had been burned down. But first, we must prove ourselves deserving of the Fey Lords’ favor by striking down anyone who dares to cross the border between Domandrod and Eordand without permission!"

The new esbagg had been carefully selected among the remnants of the destroyed Dorcurt priesthood, someone who’d kept hope and defiance alive among the Dorcurters during the darkness of the Iadthi occupation. Surely this was a worthy successor to Ladrana Emberborn? Still, to have worked so hard for the reclamation of the Autumn Court, to be the hero who saved Dorcurt, just to hand it over to someone else. It truly did sting. Yet loyalty was non-negotiable, and Dorcurt was the rightful liege of Raithtall. The Gloam Knight watched the swearing with his usual stern face, yet [Root.RulerGetName] thought “[Root.RulerGetHerselfHimself] see a hint of joy in his features.\nWhen the oath was finished, the Gloam Knight told the newly crowned Esbagg of Dorcurt rise, and all the observers bowed down before their new liege. Once the esbagg had given those present permission to stand, it was time for the festivities to begin. But before the feast could be declared, something happened that nobody would expect. The Gloam Knight spoke up again, this time looking directly at [Root.RulerGetName].\n\n‘[Root.RulerGetName], I’ve been told that it is thanks to your pious and dutiful work that we are able to hold this ceremony again.

Many of the city’s buildings have been looted, but the troops have been ordered to cease their activities and gather in the central square, awaiting [Root.Monarch.GetName] to give them [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] victory speech and further orders. This moment has long been anticipated among the [Root.GetCountryNameAdj] leadership, and extensive discussions have been had about how to proceed. The plan is for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to order the permanent destruction of the foul city, the punishment of its people for their many crimes against life itself.\nYet, [Root.Monarch.GetName] hesitates. Perhaps the scene looks too familiar to a previous scene in Dorcurt. Perhaps the sympathetic words of Erlass Whitehand have affected [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Either way, the words [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] delivers on the square are different to the ones [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had planned when entering the city. After declaring all worship of Winter outlawed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] orders the reconstruction of the damaged and looted buildings, as well as the legal protection of any Snecboth that isn’t found serving Winter. Any Snecboth who pledges their service to Autumn will get a share in the upcoming victory feast, though the biggest feast will still be reserved for the victorious soldiers of [Root.GetCountryName].\n\nThis course of action would prove controversial back in the capital. Some in Raithtall had expressed their worry back during the marriage between Dharastor III and Erlass Whitehand, and they took this as proof that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had been corrupted by the deceit of the Snecboth witch.

 flavor_raithtall.166.t:0 "Foreign Fey: Sonad Blessed"
 flavor_raithtall.166.d:0 "Once the mysterious fey reached the throne room, they called upon our sonad. After a series of whispers between the two that couldn’t be overheard, the fey laid its hand on the sonad’s head and uttered a strange enchantment. Ever since, there has been a remarkable change in the sonad. Everything from their physical prowess, to their intellectual insights, to their personal charisma seems to have been greatly enhanced by the event. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that the fey saw the spark of a glorious ruler inside the sonad, and thus transformed them into the ideal guide that our nation needed."

 flavor_raithtall.17.d:0 "Sadly, while all fey need to be shown deference for their role in saving Eordan and elven civilization, not all of them see fit to act in a way befitting their exalted station. A recent visitor to the Twilight Court decided to play an embarrassing prank on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], which will most likely be whispered about for weeks or even months to come!"
 flavor_raithtall.17.a:0 "Just bear it without losing face."
 flavor_raithtall.18.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Charms Fey Noble"
 flavor_raithtall.18.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is known for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] charms, but charming a fey noble was more than people expected even of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Recently it seems that a notable fey visitor to the Twilight Court has taken a special interest in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], finding new excuses to make visits to the palace. While of course, a ruler of [Root.GetCountryName] can never entertain affairs, having the favor of such a powerful fey could certainly improve their standing, both in Eordand and in the Feyrealm."
 flavor_raithtall.18.a:0 "Why do they look at me like that when that fey visits?"
 flavor_raithtall.19.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Averts Disaster"
 flavor_raithtall.19.d:0 "Recently, the [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] received grim news from the Domandrod. A group of fey emerged, warning of a terrible disaster that would soon hit our nation. Worried, but not shaken, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] took some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most trusted druids and went out to the edge of the Domandrod. There, they stayed for several days, conducting their ritual. Once they emerged, they proclaimed that the disaster had been averted and our people had been spared. On the news a wave of celebrations spread throughout our nation, celebrating [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] druids for their accomplishment."
 flavor_raithtall.19.a:0 "Hooray for [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_raithtall.20.t:0 "Fey Joins Praisegranting Ceremony"
 flavor_raithtall.20.d:0 "The Praisegranting Ceremony is a classic Tuathak celebration, but this year it came with an unexpected surprise. A fey from the Domandrod entered the Twilight Court, requesting to participate. But rather than asking for gifts and praise from the elven participants, it instead asked to honor [Root.Monarch.GetName] with gifts from the Domandrod itself. What can be a greater proof of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] than gaining such loyalty from the fey themselves?"
 flavor_raithtall.20.a:0 "‘I thank you, and humbly accept your offerings.’"
 flavor_raithtall.21.t:0 "Praisegranting for the Gloam Knight"
 flavor_raithtall.21.d:0 "The Praisegranting Ceremony is the most cherished tradition of the Tuathak, a chance to show our appreciation for those worthy of respect. This year, the Gloam Knight approached our court just as we got ready for the celebrations. This fortunate occasion led to the decision that this year’s Praisegranting Ceremony be held in honor of the Gloam Knight himself, for who could be more worthy of praise? It is now time for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to show all [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] vassals how to show proper deference for your betters."
 flavor_raithtall.21.a:0 "Sadly, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not have a lot to spare…"

While the death of a ruler may be a time of grief, it is also a time of opportunity, as our people look for who to listen to next." #Don't think this is needed as there are no term limits, but included just in case.
