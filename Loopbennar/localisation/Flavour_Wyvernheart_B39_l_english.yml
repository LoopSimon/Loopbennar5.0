 weapons_of_adventure_desc:0 "Once, Escann made plenty of its own weapons. Many a famed smith came out of the Blademarches, Adenica, or one of the other feudal states in the region. Yet now we must cart weapons overland from as far away as Lencenor just to make sure we can survive the night. It is expensive, impractical, and causes far too many logistical challenges when a shipment is late or lost.\n\nLet us light the forges once again, bringing together native Escanni techniques, Vernman preferences, and the eccentric developments made by individual adventurers mastering their own fighting styles. We may never be famous for making any one thing of high quality, but if you want to attach a club to a chain and then stick a gun on it, you know a Wyvernheart smith won’t even blink."

These are the sorts of warnings we have heard parents give to their children, confronted as we are by the threat of beasts in the Greatwoods.\n\nWorst of all is this "hunter of the woods" himself - the terrible werewolf threat, which regards children as easy pickings but does not balk in the face of even three armed humans. Decisive action must be taken to put an end to this sword hanging over our heads."

Yet the Gawedi do not respect this and use the river to threaten us, demanding tariffs to be paid or they will block our trade and exports.\nWe shall show them that diplomacy is best waged when our offer is backed with a hint of sulphur and a silenced murmur of incantation. What they call a mere commercial dispute is more than enough for us to come down on them with the might of a Wyvern; let us claim the banks of the Alen and neuter the Alenic kingdom.\nTheir “kingdom” is weak, their people are weak, and we will show them how to be strong, whether they want it or not."

Though unsuccessful, these experiments revealed the relative feasibility of such an idea.\nWhat is required then is a stronger focus of magic, magic with a will - a soulstone. The search for such a material has so far been fruitless, but recent rumours that have reached the inner circle of the Council suggest that there might be an answer to our needs under Aldtempel - some speak of evil magic and the resurgence of devils, but they lack the vision and might to harness this source of power.\nLet us find out what lies below this temple of old."

Some would call this work demented; to resist such a process would require a very high perseverance and tolerance to pain - a mind-shattering experience.

Removed claws, only I think now they ain't claws, make it seem more like a finger growing lots of nails entwining together, tunneling through the flesh of the fingertip, making the claw. These are sharp, so putting them in a box, flesh still moves. The corpse had a rusty shovel, there was a sort of ditch visible to me now that I look back; imagine the monster received and followed instructions somehow.\n\nThe arm itself is another oddity, hard to see - cadaver’s muscles refuse to stop twitching - they look stretched, literally, I mean. Compared the skin to leather, it is as though the leather was in a rack and pulled into a longer shape, estimating the beast’s arms without stretching would reach about below the waist rather than to the toes, oddly humanoid.\nMore convinced this is some transmutation, I found damestear in its heart; the bloody twitching stopped when I took that out at least, but I swear its head turns to wherever I move the damn tear. The way it stares, I’m thinking I was lucky to have lost my wand before finding the cadaver, or I might’ve been assaulted by it for my magic; I don’t want to think about what it could do if it were alive…\n - Tattered notes signed by Ollor of Coldmarket, minor chronicler"

Since the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had not officially censured them when they revealed their ‘invention,’ they had grown less abashed of their work. Body parts lay strewn about the laboratory. Most were orcish, some were not. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] did not want to know the details. They doubly avoided looking at the poorly concealed cages in the corner. One could almost hear whimpering coming from under the covers. Probably filthy orcs.\n\nThe mages’ communications to the court had been adamant: the royal inspection must take place tonight. The cringing woman, apparently risen to a position of prominence amongst the assembled court mages for her invention, beckoned the royal party forward. A tunnel, wide enough to fit an ox cart through, led deeper into the earth. They descended.\n\nEmerging into a torchlit underground space, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the first to recognize what the pit below them was: an arena. The giddy mage scampered off to a contraption of gears and levers and began turning, lifting one of two opposing doors within the pit. Voices gasped and blades unsheathed as a werewolf, in all its ferocity, emerged. The woman kept giggling as she raised the second door. The thing that emerged there was somehow worse.\n\nArms the length of its body raised above its head, tumorous muscles straining as it reached out to the mage who created it. What was it doing? Seeking an embrace?\n\nThe mage pointed at the snarling werewolf and said one word: “Kill.”\n\nThe thing screamed, making a noise that should not exist, and attacked.\n\nThe fight was vicious. By the time the blood loss from being disemboweled felled the thing, it had long since pried the werewolf’s head from its body. “My liege,” said the mage, smiling ear to ear. “My children merely need a name, and I feel none other than their godparent should have the honour.”"

It was not the kind of place one tread lightly.\n\nThe Sovereign and their party had been searching the caves beneath for several days now, led by the Court Mage Galleos and his divinations. Strange dreams and promises of untold power had drawn Galleos’ gaze here and with it that of his Sovereign.\n\nSo long underground, the shadows breathed unnatural life into the weird stories of this place. Guards swore they saw figures dashing into crevices that led nowhere, while the camp’s cook went missing for a day, only to return the next without a memory of having been gone.\n\nThe party greeted Galleos’ announcement that they had arrived at the place he had dreamed of with relief. Upon entering the room, however, any good cheer at the success of their journey was dashed upon seeing the solitary rusted blade stuck into the long slab of stone, all innately recognized as an altar.\n\n“What is this, Galleos?” asked Sovereign [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“It is a wishblade, [Root.Monarch.GetName]],” said a voice from behind them. All turned to see a stilted figure, clad in worn robes, with its hood drawn low. Face obscured, it continued speaking.\n\n“Long has it lain here, long enough that even I have forgotten its name.

Perhaps we should take the time to do the same,” said the Sovereign.\n\n“That’s stupid,” said the Floodborn mage matter-of-factly. Sovereign [Root.Monarch.GetName] snapped their head to the mage. Before they could chide the mage for speaking to their ruler in such a way, the oblivious mage continued as they remounted their horse.\n\n“Why limit ourselves to mimicking what was done centuries ago by those with a fraction of our knowledge and power? You are too great a Sovereign, and Wyvernheart too great a realm to settle for merely matching the accomplishments of old. If we can make the Burnbloods from spare orcs and prisoners, we can go much further using wyverns.”\n\nThe Sovereign looked at the Floodborn mage, then up at the foggy sky the wyvern had disappeared into.

But he was a good soldier, and good soldiers followed orders.\n\nDraconic screeches in the distance woke him from his reverie. “Move!” he shouted. “To positions!” Every man moved with practiced speed to their firing positions, as two riders came out of the wood on the grassy clearing's opposite side. Floodborn, whose job it had been to lure the beast from the nearby Trialmount. Based on their haste, Lorens figured they had succeeded.\n\n“Load!”\n\nWinches rotated, springs pulled taught, and malicious-looking bolts loaded. They heard the beast before seeing it. Flapping its wings in great gusts of wind, all men would have sworn it to be a dragon re-awoken to terrorize the world once more.

Now.\n\n“Fire!”\n\nA salvo of metal bolts flew out from the treeline. Most missed, but one buried into the wyvern's chest, killing it instantly.

This became the focus for the past few years and has now come to fruition; the Floodborn Council will now be reestablished.\n\nThe first members of the new council approach the Sovereign, crimson robes adorning their figures. The soft velvet of their robes touches the floor as they bow before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. An indiscernible bond between them exists, as the councillors look up to the Sovereign; a sort of kinship can be felt. None of them are of the same blood; they are not family. And yet all have the same blood flowing in their veins - the blood and magic of The Regent, the most powerful floodborn Wyvernheart has ever witnessed.\nAs the bowing councillors rise up, a flash of crimson in their eyes. They are the Scions, the "heirs" of The Regent, magically empowered and biologically upgraded, but also perfectly loyal and incapable of repeating the mistakes of the Council of old.\n\nNow a new era dawns upon the council, the era of the Scions, an era where the Council is the extended arm of the Sovereign, and their rule is uncontested."

Their mastery of multiple schools of magic grants them even greater access to the levers of the nation, as they seem more and more interested in one day ruling it.\n\nDespite not being in the direct line of succession, the Council has decreed that they shall be named heir for the moment, with the hope that some time shall temper their arrogance while keeping them ambitious for when they do take the throne and lead our nation to greater heights.\n\nThe gods above watch and weep, knowing that with scions like this and more to come, the age of arcanum is here and that soon our entire aristocracy shall be as if they were walking Avatars, one and all.

The prime suspect is obvious, but our rulers are all gifted floodborn, so the possibility of hiding this via illusion or other magicks to avoid being removed from power is a feasible possibility.\n\nThe council will have to confirm and make sure this investigation does not provoke the anger of The Regent."

The collapsing rubble being held partly aloft or falling gently as various abjuration magicks activate. Too late to save those within and only exposing any survivors further while they hold.\n\nNot all are worried for safety, however, as a dozen Floodborn assault the rubble to make sure their deed is done. Blood runs in the streets, and the promised heir lies dead. Seemingly slain in the initial conflagration of the Tower.\n\nThe rubble continues to fall as the abjuration wards finally give in, and as the smoke and dust cloy and linger in the air, flashes of spellweaving can be seen by the majority of spell-shocked observers. The crescendo builds, the way that flashes and sounds fly like an impromptu orchestra. But there is no conductor and only destruction in these instruments wake.\n\nIt ends sooner than one might expect, the final three of the would-be assassins slain in an instant and exsanguinated by The Regent’s might. His eyes flare red as he storms out of the dust cloud and bellows out orders and exhortations of vengeance alike. The heir is dead, and all shall know the depths of his wrath."

 flavour_wyvernheart.301.d:0 "The Floodborn Council is anything but a united group; members of the councils belong to at least one or two cliques - they are not impervious to pettiness and self-interest. But among these squabbling cliques, a few set themselves apart by their beliefs, by their means, and mostly by their influence within the council room.\nEven though they are floodborn, the “Scions” of rich merchants and aristocrats have not forgotten their roots and lobby heavily for their family's interest. While some, more “Ambitious” or strict “Hardliners” floodborn want to push the council to action, the former for their own interest and reputation and the latter for the efficiency of the realm.\nThere are the “Technocrats”, those that have begun to experiment frenetically, leaving behind everything for the sake of knowledge and power. While the “Heartmages” are adventurers first and floodborn second.\nThe one thing that brings them together is magic and its embodiment, the Sovereign. All respect the Sovereign in different ways, be it as a nobleman and arbiter, but a few esotericists have devoted themselves to the Flood as a religious entity and serve the council as the Flood’s “Devouts”.\n\nAs most of the appointed councillors take their seats, the different groups become rather apparent in the stands. Each group organises around their representative, who will present their agenda in the coming session; looks are exchanged between the representatives, gauging each other - alliances and betrayals are commonplace in this room.\nWho knows what today’s session will bring forth?"

Tears of grief and anger spill out as they shout at each other and exchange blows.\n“Were we not those that heralded the Flood as that which will change Halann? Was our devotion not enough, and punishment is upon us?” - lashes out a Devout.\n“We are Devouts of the Flood, and its avatar, its voice still leads us even if the skies weep no more!” - chastises another.\nA profound schism has occurred, their belief shattered in pieces, and now they try to build themselves a new identity from the ashes.\nThe reason?

Now that Castonath is ours, how shall we rebuild it? The Castonathi Heartman should suffer our indecision no longer."\n\nAnd one by one, each group presented their project in great detail; the Devouts quickly folded, as Castonath held no real import to them, while no Ambitious Floodborn were in attendance. The Heartmages held no real position on this as long as the city was rebuilt.\n\nThe three proposals that drew support were the following:\nThe Hardliners desire a centre of administration to centralise the realm.\nThe Wealthy Scions wish to prop up Castonath as the centre of wealth in Wyvernheart, which would fund the Council’s agendas.\nAnd a surprising yet popular proposal from the Technocrat Arcanists to create a grand Floodborn Academy to strengthen the council at the roots."

On the other hand, some councillors are often absent in sessions, most of the time due to their missions for Heartmages or out of a lack of interest in the agenda presented for the Technocrats.\n\nThe Hardliners are the Heart of the Machine, their strictness also applies in their work and their expectation of others, to the great dismay of Noble and Merchant Scions whose seats are tied to their gifts and not the work they put in.\n\nFinally, the more ambitious of the Floodborn find themselves leading smaller groups of councillors, trying to further their own standing.

They claim that the Sovereign's recent actions aren't befitting of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position and as such are challenging their rule.\nOn the other side, the Devouts of the Flood, growing in number and influence, chastise their brethren for not being able to see "the Purpose," as they call it.\nWhereas the Heartmages and Technocrats seem very disinterested in this happening, the Sovereign won’t find support with them.\n\nIt is up to the Sovereign to calm the tensions in the council room, or ignore them outright; the Sovereign can ignore the Council at their own risk."
