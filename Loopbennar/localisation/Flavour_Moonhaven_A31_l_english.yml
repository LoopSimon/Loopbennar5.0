 A31_ibevar_desc:0 "Ibevar and Moonhaven have never been on the good terms, almost entirely due to ideological differences. The founder of Moonhaven, Varilor Bluetongue, promoted and idea of cannorization of moon elves and integration into human society. Meanwhile, Ibenion I - the founder of Ibevar - sought to establish a purely elven realm in Cannor. Under some consideration, Varion 'The Young' has decided to arange a meeting with the Ibevari nobility, officially to 'bring forth the age of peace among moon elves.' There is however a personal issue behind this meeting, as Varion's uncle currently resides in Ibevar..."

 A31_anbenncost_desc:0 "Anbenncóst, the capital of the Empire, was significantly damaged during the Lilac Wars. Our fellow elves of Anbenncóst have suffered too, and it is our duty as the elven elector to support them and provide relief. We should organise a state visit to Anbenncóst and provide help them in any way we can, such as inviting those who suffered in the war to settle in Port Munas. The two cities share many similarities and the change should be fairly painless."

 A31_lesser_anbenncost_desc:0 "Port Munas has always been considered a smaller sibling city to Anbenncóst with the local human population having a similar identity to that of Anbenncósters. Our recent diplomatic mission to the imperial capital saw a city breathing with life, full of all kind of races found in the empire. We should aim to make Port Munas even more alike its sister city by inviting other races of Anbennar. Let Moonhaven have its own little Anbenncóst."

 A31_true_to_rc_desc:0 "The debate is over and one thing is clear - this Corinite heresy cannot stand and will not find support in Moonhaven. Munas ascended to the court led by Castellos and his son Adean, and he would most definitely support the rightful heir. And so must we, the Moon Elves, follow our founder. Unfortunately, some heretics are already present within our borders and we will have to deal with them first."

 A31_new_alliances_title:0 "Form New Alliances"
 A31_new_alliances_desc:0 "The Corinites continue spreading their lies across the empire, threating the stability of Anbennar. Luckily, there are plenty of other righteous countries in the empire who stand with Adean and defy Corin and her rabid mob of followers. Just like the elves of past joined in arms with countries of Cannor to fight Nichmer so must we unite the empire in order to safeguard it from the Corinites."

 A31_saving_misguided_desc:0 "To our north lie the lands of Istralore, our former ally and fellow supporter of House Silmuna and the Grand Duchy of Dameria. And now, their lands are overrun with Corinites, their soldiers praising her name. Our hearts are filled with sorrow for our misguided human comrades who were fed deceitful lies of Corin. But their oppression will soon end. We shall call upon our rangers and our allies and liberate Istralore from itself, bringing it back to the Regent Court. They will resist, but we know what is the best for them."

 A31_liberating_brethren_title:0 "Liberating Our Brethren"
 A31_liberating_brethren_desc:0 "With Istralore firmly secured under our protection we may now look at the rest of the empire. Both the Lilac Wars and the Corinite heresy have shown us the weakest parts of the empire and how shaky the elven security in Anbennar is. Moonhaven used to count on someone else to protect elves outside of Silverwoods, first Dameria and then Istralore. We lost Dameria and barely managed to bring Istralore back. This cannot stand. We will have to take action ourselves and implement direct control over elven lands in the empire if we are to ensure security and freedom of all moon elves."

Most fools that joined the Corinites have abandoned that vile heresy and those who didn't... well, they made their choice clear. Our realm is secure from within, and the time has come to secure it from all external threats too. Heretics are still a threat to the empire, and Moonhaven shall aid in striking this evil down."

 A31_elven_place_empire_title:0 "Elven Place in the Empire"
 A31_elven_place_empire_desc:0 "Our efforts at securing the safety of Anbennar have been a tremendous success. The dominance of Adean was secured in the empire and the corinites are now in retreat. And all of this is in large part due to our help. The new emperor wisely acknowledged the part our elven rangers played in securing their position and the defeat of corinites, and accepted our proposal of expanding elven towns across the empire. The empire is strong and the moon elves have great influence in Cannor. The time for peace and prosperity of moon elves has come. Our people are safe and will remain this way for as long as both Moonhaven and the Empire last."

 A31_new_path_title:0 "The New Path"
 A31_new_path_desc:0 "After some debate we have decided that Moonhaven stands with Istralore and Corin! Munas would most certainly support Corin's cause, as when he arrived with elves to Cannor he led the fight against evil head on, just like the Corinites proclaim we shall do. Together with our human allies we shall spread Her word throughout the empire, to both humans and elves."

Her legacy as a legendary warrior still persist in the hearts of Istralorian soldiers, known in Moonhaven for being excellent warriors. While our elven troops are also a prideful sight we could still learn something from our human cousins. We shall request Istralore to send us some of their officers to oversee our troops and share some of their military training."

Now, its eastern part is split into Moonhaven and Istralore, an elven dominated and a human dominated realms. This divide affects our capability of working together as a single union and should be mitigated as soon as possible. A proposal was made by some of our advisors to exchange population with Istralore, creating a smoother transition between our states."

Due to the ongoing religious conflicts it has been proposed to more effectively utilize our zealots, for example sending them to help Istralore on their frontlines. And thus, Moonhaven has decided to form Order of the Lamp, who will be the shining light of Corinites in these dark times."

 A31_corin_light_title:0 "Under Corin's Light"
 A31_corin_light_desc:0 "Victory, at last! With our help the light of Corin has been spread and legitimised across the empire. Both elves and human alike now accept Her as the true successor to Castellos and not that weak and craven Adean. With our ally on the throne Moonhaven has risen in prominence across Anbennar too. With pride we could now say that the empire is strong and secure for elves and humans alike."

 A31_greater_revelation_title:0 "Greater Revelation"
 A31_greater_revelation_desc:0 "Many years have passed since the religious upheavals surrounding the mural of Castellos washed over Moonhaven. Many things have changed both in Moonhaven and elsewhere and more grand revelations have been made. Our beliefs are not the destination as we once believed, but rather a mere stop before the truth of Ravelianism. Our ancestors have committed a heinous crime of theft, and wronged all other races of Halanna. Precursors cannot be forgiven for this. But we can. Moonhaven shall lead the elves as it did before, but not in the name of Corin, who we once thought a Goddess rather than a saint, or Adean, who we once thought as more than an aspect of a greater divinity  but in the name of redemption. The redemption for all elvenkind. The redemption for our ancient sins. All elves across Anbennar shall join us and help all other races uncover more secrets of the world. We owe them this much at least."

 A31_flow_current_desc:0 "As the truth of Ravelianism spreads throughout our markets and harbors it is obvious to all that we can’t practice alone. Moonhaven has been the diplomatic and mercantile heart of the imperial elves, and gained much influence in other circles as well. Now it’s time to use that influence to spread the truth. We will gain the favor of the church leaders and the support of other imperial princes and urban magnates, as our teahouses become places for the astute to ponder new revelations from the almighty. No longer will rumination on the divine be confined to ancient temples or hidden shrines, now faith is a matter for the merchant, the academic and even more so for the artificer."

 A31_modernize_moonhaven_desc:0 "The Riverglade academy was founded only shortly after the War of the Sorcerer King’s end, meant in part to study, catalog and remember the knowledge of our long abandoned homeland. In the years since it became a key site of higher education, both accessing and contributing to the archives at Konwell and the Moonmount Library, and further took on cultural focus as a center for academia, with many of the Ravelian scholars now in our nation having first heard of the faith as student’s in it’s hallowed halls. Now we have more knowledge and indeed resources flowing back from our ancient homeland than ever before. The Riverglade academy must be funded once more, and more universities established and expanded across our realm. Many of the Ravelian students will return as professors to teach the natural sciences, geography, history, theology and most important of all, Artificery."

 A31_industrialize_artificery_desc:0 "While we have started to develop our own native crop of students, they will only end up working elsewhere at institutes with less prestige but more access to the most up to date discoveries. However, one of the Riverglade lecturers on economic theory has started a discussion group that has brought in many students of engineering, mathematics, sociology and artificery. They have drafted plans for large scale economic reforms to increase our access to precursor relics, increase our manufacturing capacity and modernize production sites that have long held a misguided focus on artisanal hand crafted goods. \n\nFurthermore, the plans promise to not only grow the economy, but to draw in expert workers and new scientific investment from across the empire. This change in approach and ready supply of well educated experts would reveal new technological insights to us and ensure we’re always in a position to keep up with the younger races."
 
 A31_school_thought_title:0 "The School of Thought"
 A31_school_thought_desc:0 "It’s long been true that educated elves were more likely to find electoral success, but historically the desired education has been confined to rhetoric and legal or political studies, with perhaps an understanding of economics. Now though, much of the electorate becomes familiar with and dependent on artificery that is not enough. The student groups that divide themselves into Brillites, Techno-Thaumaturges and Mechanists have joined the realm of politics, and prefer educated candidates to lead them into the future. \n\nNow ambitious young elves spend less time at galas and more in university libraries, as the new electorate demands representatives up to date with modern sciences and all applicable areas of study. They move to dissect rhetoric and economics with the same keen gaze they have applied to arcana and theology and have massively advanced the domain of political science. As elves we are able to study widely across our lifespans, and so while our human neighbors have need to settle for leaders well read in but a few areas, our best are able to spend centuries undergoing rigorous study and research, then bring that learning to the highest civil and administrative positions in our republic."

Founded in the aftermath of the Interregnum, it was meant to provide divergent people from across the continent a way to resolve their differences, eliminate want and channel magic without war and death sweeping over the imperial peoples. For too long, petty infighting and religious conflicts have prevented it from living up to these ideals, instead entrenching magical power in a restrictive elite and denying the true nature of the world around them and the heavens above. \n\nAt last we have an opportunity to end this, to bring Ravelianism into the highest halls of the empire. Share its gifts of insight and invention, turn the magical nobles who hoarded the divine gift of magic into faithful servants of the people and empower artificery as the magic of all imperias. This divine insight will allow the empire to at last live up to the ideals it was founded on. Community and Unity for all under the one true god."

Already, our closest friends and allies in Istralore have joined the Corinite movement and some of Her worshippers are now spreading around Moonhavener countryside with several elven officials demanding a resolution regardless the religious situation here.

While trade kept us rich, it did not pay for new cities and new societies the same way the revelations around tea did. \n\nNow though among the Vyzemby halflings off the southern coast of Sarhal we discover another opportunity.

Secondly the local Basshidi seem to have some strange advantage in these waters, forewarned of underwater hazards in a way even our canniest captains cannot match. \n\nHowever, recent news could promise to change that. The crew of the Starguide, a large merchant ship, have recently returned to Moonhaven on another vessel after being forced to beach their ship on what the locals call the Tajame Plains. They return with stories of rolling coastal grasslands perfect for the growing of spices, and of friendly locals who they call the Baashidi.

The local merchants said it sharpens the mind, and awakens the soul, making one ready for study or philosophy. Frankly, if this is all they drink beforehand we believe we know why they concluded the gods are tyrants who ought to be toppled from the heavens. This coffee is bile, far worse than even the other varieties of that miserable drink. \n\nIt is our duty to stop such things, while the efforts might be great we must find or crossbreed some variety of tea that grows readily in these Sarhali soils.

Unfortunately the secret of Rial Thae has been lost, but with our numerous global plantations we stand a chance of recreating it. We shall fund a research to try and recreate it, but the question is who to hire for this job? Our mages seem like the best option as they claim that the precursors were powerful mages and that the secret is certainly hiding within usage of magic. On the other hand, the artificers have shown their interest. While generally disliked by most elves in our government, the artificers have a point in claiming that the magic of precursor times is long gone and that only their artificery can come close to recreating Rial Thae. The choice is ours."

During the Lilac Wars we ended up on the other side of the conflict with our brethren from the Elfrealm of the Redglades, and we since haven't properly reestablished out contacts with them. Our ruler, Varion 'The Young' has decided to personally attend this matter and sent a meesage asking to arrange a feast between our two countries in Redglades. If they do accept it will be the point of reconcilation of old wound, if any are still there."

Despite breaking away from Munas to create their own country away from all other elves they still maintain an identity similar to that of ours. Regardless, we are all elves and thus can and shall work together. Our investigations into Venáil have already improved our ships, now it is time to improve our ports as well. We just might persuade the Celmaldori to help us and share their own knowledge if we work on their own harbour as well."

This region is filled with warlords fighting over what remains of precursor civilization and worshipping the previous warlords as gods. This land, despite being absolutely barbarous, is useful to us due to the number of precursor relics and local tea plantations, which will be better off under our control. Moonhaven will most definitely come into conflict with the locals, but luckily we know of a certain explorer willing to lead our expeditionary force into Taychend."

Local Ruinborn elves have allied themselves with the fey to survive the Ruin and are generally much better off then most other survivors we have encountered in Aelantir. Most interestingly and importantly to us, the locals also have tea. The city of Elchos is known to have a certain type of herbal tea, said to contain the very aroma of the spring itself! We should get our hands on these samples and see and expand its production from being limited to just one city."

The dwarves picture a mine, picks and blasting powder piled high to carve more caverns and tunnels into the earth, leaving ugly gashes behind as they do so. Halflings picture the hammer and  plow, turning any land into a breadbasket and piling new homes atop one another. The gnomes hardly seem to know what growth means, preferring to  fiddle with strange devices. \n\nInstead, our experts in the AIECOCA further the growth of the imperial peoples with the ship, the ledger and the pen. Elves who have spent decades overseeing colonial efforts gather to plan out each settlement with an unmatched degree of expertise. We translate the local languages, map out the climate, decide on issues of jurisdiction among colonial governments and identify promising local industries all before a single elven life is risked on foreign soil. The benefits such colonial planning have provided us are self-evident and now it’s time to reinvest in them and pursue true mastery in these arts."

Why shouldn't Moonhavener fleets be seen all around Halann? Haless is said to contain plenty of riches desired in Cannor, and who but us should be the one to get them? But the journey to the east is long and risky, hence why we should establish a port somewhere around the many isles surrounding Sarhal."

The amulet was never opened while on sea, but after setting foot on Cannorian shore the amulet miraculously opened. Inside Oloris found several dried up seeds of a plant, with neither elves nor humans being able to tell him what plant it was. Oloris chose chose to plant and raise the mystery plant and was surprised when it grew up to become tea. Tea never grew in Cannor before, and Oloris chose to use this opportunity to establish first elven tea plantations. Since then the plantations have grown by and large with Moonhaven still being the top tea exporter in Dameria and Cannor."

Munas went on to form the Silmuna dynasty and ascend as a new God, while his brother Varilor established Moonhaven and acted as a guide for moon elves in the following decades. Following his death, various other members of the Bluetongue dynasty were elected in Moonhaven with the next three centuries being known as The Bluetongue Era. The influence of the Bluetongues waned following the formation of the New Empire, but the dynasty still maintained some influence in the area with the Bluetongue Era being seen as the golden era of Moonhaven."

Two elven officers, one from Redglades and one from Moonhaven were talking there. They looked just over 200 and were surely fighting during the war. Maybe they even met at a battlefield?

Varion's uncle has fled to Ibevar following Wexonard coonquest of Varivar, and Varion has not been in contact with him since, not having the blessing of his uncle to lead Bluetongues and the moon elves.

 A31_flavour.24.d:0 "After the Captain of the Moonsinger returned to South Sarhal she‘s taken a few of the new settlers with her to meet with the local leaders who helped the crew during their time stranded there. Initial meetings are marked by uncertainty, as the Baashidi did not know we would be returning but after a few meetings they have sent some of their diplomats to speak with us. It seems they are open to working alongside us as partners, impressed by the goods of Cannor and Aelentir our ships have brought to their shores. They even explain some enlightening details about the merfolk, allies of theirs who dwell beneath the waves and have a unique advantage in navigating those waters. \n\nHowever for all they offer us the fact remains. They are strange folk, their merchants compete greedily with our growers and chartered companies and their religion is strange and deeply heathen. They in one breath acknowledge that Munas may have ascended to the heavens and in another claim he must have made war against the Dame to do so. Can we ever trust such people?"
 A31_flavour.24.a:0 "As they seek to share their local knowledge we would be fools not to accept it."
 A31_flavour.24.b:0 "We cannot trust such strange folk to be reliable allies."
 A31_flavour.25.t:0 "Ravelianism in Moonhaven"
 A31_flavour.25.d:0 "News has arrived from the south, our long term allies in Moonhaven have formally announced their adoption of this strange new Ravelian faith, and this news has brought great trouble to the court. While many think nothing of it, or else shun the elves for their abandoning what was long held as the truth, others were moved to consideration by this announcement. The Elves have long been thought of as wise and patient folk and would not do such a thing without forethought. Perhaps we ought to examine some long held assumptions and take this chance to once again lead the empire in adopting new religious understandings."
 A31_flavour.25.a:0 "Let us praise Saint Corin, Blessed of the one true God."
 A31_flavour.25.b:0 "The Elves will do as they may, we know who leads in the heavens."

 A31_flavour.26.a:0 "We shall embrace the new ways."
 A31_flavour.26.b:0 "In the other hand, the republic has worked us well until now."
