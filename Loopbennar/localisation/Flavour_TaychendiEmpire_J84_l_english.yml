 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_title: "Setting the Sun"
 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_desc: "The “Jaherian Exemplars” – the prodigal sons and daughters of Tacenie’s empire. They came to Taychend to disperse the darkness, but in their arrogance they made two mistakes. First, they awoke a force even they could not control, their words the spark to the greatest peasant and slave movement since Vehasha’s own. Secondly, they underestimated us. Underestimated our people, underestimated our power, underestimated our history. They seek to destroy everything that made us great – but we will not let them."

 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_title: "Hero-Cults of the Exemplary"
 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_desc: "The Exemplars are powerful beyond measure, a military and religious organisation without equal – but they turned their power to foolish pursuits, chasing shadows across Aelantir and beyond. Their organisation is so similar to the organisation of our own Hero-Cults and religious brotherhoods – if we turned their cult of exemplary into a cult of glory, we could use their power in the expansion of our Empire, while the Warlord-Heralds do what they wish with the Dry Coast. \n\nThere are, of course, those who view this as a fool’s errand too – should this effort prove too difficult, we can simply expel these prodigal elves, and fold the Taychendi immigrants who had moved to their lands into our empire."

 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_title: "Ending an Exile"
 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_desc: "The Dugui’hi, the original denizens of the Mushroom Forest to the north. Their mercenaries and travelling alchemists have been a notable if uncommon sight through Taychend since their exile in the 1200s – but all know their eyes have always been on their original home. The Advakhalla of Sedregenghi were close to supporting an effort to end their exile in the mid 1400s, but the venture failed – by finishing the job, we may be able to add to our empire a valuable new province indeed, as the riches of the Mushroom Forest will flow to us from a grateful people."

 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_title: "Strategic Herbicide"
 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_desc: "The jungle to the north has always been an impenetrable wall, but the world has changed – war has changed! We are no longer the frightened children skirting the edge of the jungle, stealing wood and hunting the dregs that crawl out of the treeline – with the secrets of artificery opening themselves to us, the possibility of launching an organised campaign of colonisation against the Effelai has become tantalisingly real! First, however, we must decide exactly how much of these new weapons we wish to deploy against the jungle…"

 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_title: "Bloom and Bust"
 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_desc: "So the jungle finally wakes, and seeks to destroy us? So be it – our battle shall be legendary! As the Effelai blooms, our mages and artificers believe that we now have a golden opportunity to destroy it for good.\n\nAt a command, the orders can be sent out, the warlords called to the Imperial banner – soon, two-hundred thousand will march on the jungle, flame-throwing staves and sparkdrive cannon in their hands. The Effelai blooms – let’s make it go bust!"

 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_title: "There Stood the Grass"
 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_desc: "As our artificers and mages scavenge the effelai’s “corpse”, we have discovered that our victory may not be as total as we thought – and we have realised that may not be such a bad thing. The Effelai is not truly dead, but fractured – and those fractured remnants might be controllable.\n\nIf we are to advance, you must seize those remnants, turn them to use. Ignore opposition, ignore your hesitation – where once stood living grass, now lies reanimated power."

 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_title: "A Fleet Born of Fire"
 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_desc: "The scourged forest held many secrets, but above all those it also had a wealth of high-quality lumber. Already some of our warlords have moved north, setting up camps through the scorched remains of the Effelai. Go and sponsor these Woodcutter-Warlords, and connect their camps to newly built shipyards along the Effelai coast.\n\nSoon, we shall begin converting the jungle’s riches into the greatest fleet the world has ever seen – born of fire, and more glorious than flame!"

 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_shore_title: "Fear on Every Shore"
 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_shore_desc: "More ships leave our Effelai shipyards by the day – so build more.\n\nOur fleets grow, and the oceans of Halann reveal themselves to vainglorious eyes, battle-hungry and blood-thirsty – so let them off the leash.\n\nWhen you’re finished, and we rule the ocean? Nobody will ever look at the sea again and feel safe."

 J84_1_14_shadow_and_blood_title: "Shadow and Blood"
 J84_1_14_shadow_and_blood_desc: "Sarhal brims with magic – and that means it brims with new secrets to uncover as well. With the Shadowswamp, a land of twisting darkness, and the Ashama, a people cursed by forces unknown, so close to our new provinces, we simply cannot let this opportunity past.\n\nYou must raise a new magical institution around the dark tower of Metat Tagokag – cursed, but brimming with energy. Support our efforts, and we shall unweave the windings spells of shadow and blood – and turn them to the Empire’s advantage."

 #Column 2
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_title: "Institutional Apotheosis"
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_desc: "The veneration of a ruler’s ancestors is a powerful tool in any warlord’s playbook. It allows one to cast themselves as having the personal favour of those gods, by virtue of blood, and provides a direct channel with which any subject can direct sacrifices and offerings to the ruling dynasty. The Imperial Cult, therefore, is a vital part of any Taychendi empire – and it will be for our own as well. By building temples to the imperial family’s deceased members and previous rulers, and investing into a powerful organisation that will oversee the various hero-cults to those ascended gods, we can entrench the image of the imperial family, and remind all of the glory of our empire."

 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_title: "The Weaver of Fates"
 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_desc: "The Fateweaver of Korrimutren is one of the most powerful oracles anywhere in the world, a great divination relic hooked directly into the skeletal corpse of a Precursor mage, that can allow a powerful enough divination mage to see directly – and almost always truly – into the future. The Fateweaver’s predictions have driven Taychendi history – they sparked the Chendhyan invasions, brought low the First Gophiran empire and in the process ensured the Second Empire’s rise, and, of course, it granted Laskaris the Conqueror a fate-woven shield of quasi-immortality that would spur his conquests in Taychend. We cannot leave fate to chance – it is time [Root.Monarch.GetName] paid the Weaver of Fates a visit."

 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_title: "Agricultural Evolution"
 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_desc: "The land of Taychend, and the three great rivers that dominate it – the Vyech, the Endioka, the Kalavend – is one of the most bountiful in Taychend. When the glaciers melt, and the storm clouds gather, the farms of Taychend produce enough grain to feed tens of millions. At the height of the Second Gophiran Empire, it is said that Taychend’s goliath agricultural base supported a population of 40 million – but the death throes of Gophira ravaged that base. By 1400, the Taychendi population had dropped by half. If we are to become the greatest empire Taychend has ever seen, we will need to invest in plant growth magic, grain silos, irrigation – and not just expand, but evolve that which feeds our cities and our armies."

 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_title: "Paths of Ascention"
 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_desc: "The Violet Library, the venerable institution that formed the heart of the enlightened and prosperous Dannuka Dumrusvarn of Taychendi late antiquity, is known for expending tremendous effort into documenting the deeds of any god heroes they can find, storing tens of thousands of records within their labyrinthine archives.\n\nIn their efforts, they have developed a concept called “the Thousand Paths of Ascension”, which seeks to highlight paths aside from warfare that can lead to apotheosis. If we are to build a glorious empire, we need our smiths, our architects, our dockhands, our shopkeeps and bakers – we cannot have everyone throwing themselves into the fray of battle. Perhaps, then, it may be worth officially supporting this idea?"

 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_title: "Unravelling Divinity"
 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_desc: "The Ravelians are a group dedicated to uncovering the secrets of Halann and beyond – and, as their organisation spreads through the tendrils of Cannor’s colonial networks, we are beginning to understand just how many secrets they have uncovered.\n\nAdvanced knowledge of shadowy organisations, extraplanar exploration, artificer knowledge that would put even the Vustarin to shame… already, some of our warlords have been trying to gain the Ravelian’s trust, and thus access to their secrets – but before we can officially sanction this, we must learn more about this new group."

 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_title: "The Gifts of Cerachmanu"
 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_desc: "Cerachmanu, what we call the prisons beneath the world, and the Cannorians call the Infernal Planes. It is a dark place, full of beings as evil as they are powerful – and that power has proven itself attractive to many in Taychend through the years.\n\nVarious Taychendi groups, like the Cennayakuta of Imarchend, have a long history of consorting with devils and demons. With new knowledge from the Ravelian archives now available to us, it is high time you exploited that which lies away from the eyes of the gods."

 J84_2_9_its_in_the_blood_title: "It's in the Blood"
 J84_2_9_its_in_the_blood_desc: "Now that we have accepted the Errant Princess’ offer, it is time to make good on our end of the deal. By increasing the influence of Mihaela’s new vampiric clan within our realm and military, and rooting out any potential threats to our new bloody regime, we can ascend to a power we had never believed possible."

 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_title: "Sanguosynthesis"
 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_desc: "At their core, elves are animals. We are born, we eat, we reproduce, we die. But we reproduce to our limit. Taychendi families are – the Imperial Population is – only so large as our resources allow. And our army is only so large as our population is.\n\nBut we reproduce to our limit. So build more farms, increase production, render our fields fertile. And with the fruit of the ground, the blood of the earth? Fuel the blood of conquest… people. Bodies for the war machine, for the banners, uncountable and infinite.\n\nTaychend rises to its limit. Raise it."

 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_title: "Orphans of Aesadas"
 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_desc: "The Ozgar orcs have grown restless under the control of a slaving empire such our own – so we’ll have to force them to kneel. There is one thing both them and us know for real – might makes right. And so an Ozarm’Chadash will decide this issue. You must fight in it.\n\nAfter that, the fate of the Orphans of Aesadas is in your hands. Ducaniel, the scion of Aesadas, created them, but even he didn’t have that power. They slipped through his grasp – they will not slip through ours. Isn’t that glorious?"

 J84_2_12_the_lizardfolk_expedition_title: "The Lizardfolk Expedition"
 J84_2_12_the_lizardfolk_expedition_desc: "For centuries, we did not know what the statues and tapestries represented – vague representations of our ancestors striking down scaled foes from across the sea, huge spires cracked and splintered under our might. We know now, though. 7000 years ago, our ancestors embarked on a great expedition, to utterly destroy the Lizardfolk’s ancient civilisation.\n\nThe Lizardfolk have rebuilt themselves over the years – and so the opportunity presents itself to not just redo what the Precursors did, but surpass them. Take the fleets, prepare our forces at Teramzerai, and the War of the Second Usurpation will begin!"

 J84_2_13_the_burning_harbours_title: "The Burning Harbours"
 J84_2_13_the_burning_harbours_desc: "The Lizardfolk are a truly great people, their mastery in arts, sciences and magic clear to see. When the war is over, when we have integrated these people into our empire, we may make use of their strength in our banners – but for now, we will make use of their strength in another way.\n\nKarrask, Nazhni, Khugra, the great port cities of the coastal Lizardfolk? Let us loose on them. We will reap the riches of our conquest, and send them back to your realm, and the burning harbours, set alight by our mage-flame, will be the beacon of the Empire’s arrival. All you need do is stand by and watch…"

 J84_2_14_the_second_usurpation_title: "The Second Usurpation"
 J84_2_14_the_second_usurpation_desc: "The enemy gave all they had, but they still fell before us like reeds against the hurricane. How could they not? Now, as we stand in the scoured ruins of Zerat, trains of loot, slaves and ancient technology passing through, we may complete that which we started, and finally surpass our ancestors.\n\nGive us the order, and we will usurp the Golden Scales once again… and this time, we shall hold them for good!"

 #Column 3
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_title: "A Warlord Empire"
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_desc: "Ebenanth, Yodhan, Varanash, Ultarlan, Olhokar – we stand in the same place those great conquerors once stood: unifier of Taychend. But we are only here because the empires of those elves crumbled after their deaths, as they either exploded into rebellion or stagnated and weakened over decades – we must not repeat the same mistake.\n\nWe are an empire of warlords – our power is built on them, and our future greatness will be won by them. But unlike our predecessors, as our conquests bring those warlords loot and plunder, we will not waste those riches – our ambition and our glory will be the crucible that will raise cities, monuments, bend the way of the world itself! Taychend will rise once more, as the empire to end all empires, and Taychend will rise alone, by it’s own strength – as the Empire Vainglorious!"

 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_title: "Vaona Gophira"
 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_desc: "The Gophirans moved millions of elven slaves across their empire at their height, using them to construct great monuments and extract the resources of their empire. Though we must do the same, there is a great problem – we can no longer rely on the wars of glory, the unrestricted wars between warlords, that truly supported Taychend’s slave population. To kickstart our slave economy, we must look abroad for new targets, and stimulate the various slave markets through our empire. Only then can the Periyodhai, the constant semi-ritualised battles between warlords and city-states, sustain the cycle of terror and brutality that underpins the engines of vainglory."

 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_title: "A Land of Cities"
 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_desc: "In Taychend, the city-state is the base unit of politics and society. They range in size from walled farming-villages to great metropolises, their warlords ranging from respected community members appointed by their community to absolutist warlord-kings, who can command tens of thousands of warriors. Care must be paid to those small city-states, of course – but that is the job of the greater ones. By investing in those greater city states, we can create scores of star-like cities, that radiate their prosperity out to the territories under their control."

 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_title: "Beyond Taychend"
 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_desc: "Andeios is ours. The heart of southern Aelantir, a land of magnificent cities, great peoples, legendary stories and myths, is now under our total control. But as we have so dearly learned, there is a world beyond Taychend – the Empire Vainglorious may rise alone, but it will not rise in isolation.\n\nNew ways of dealing with magic are being pioneered, new religions, professing ancient truths and possessing cutting-edge innovations, are sprouting up across the world. And the warlords, gorged on the vainglory of their conquests, are clamouring for new foes to invade, new riches to plunder – and as news of new discoveries arrive in our ports, they clamour for new secrets to unlock and powers to gain. We won’t deny their demands. \n\nOne wonders if we could…"

 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_title: "No Stone Unturned"
 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_desc: "The Slaver-Nobles, the Precursor elves who used to rule Taychend before the ruin, left countless ruins dotting the landscape of Taychend. While many of them have already been ransacked for artefacts and relics, or even dismantled for their Precursor steel and scrap, there remains a great many of them hidden below ground, out of sight – but not necessarily out of reach. We need more relics for our burgeoning experiments with Artificery – and if we have to dig up half of Taychend to find them, so be it!"

 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_title: "The Way of Warlords"
 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_desc: "To the warlords, might makes right, victory makes glory – and autonomy allows more victory. It is those beliefs, however, that caused so much trouble for empires past.\n\nThere are two approaches to this problem – one follows the path of the Mudaliars: to sit up on the high chair and make oneself an aid, not a hindrance, to the ambitions of your subordinates. The other is the path of the Gophirans – assert your power, remind your vassals that a restrained warlord can win more glory than a dead one. If we are to further Imperial power, you will need to pick that."

 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_title: "The New Relic-Lords"
 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_desc: "Since the Ruin, the Taychendi have been using the relics of the past to win glory in the present, powerful magical artefacts destroying armies and sundering cities. But the world is changing, and as kingdoms of glory turns into an Empire of Vainglory, warlords must change with them. \n\nThe new practice of Artificery will revolutionise our armies – and in doing so, the Relic-Lords of a new age shall rise, the Techno-Warlords unleashed. Integrate artificery into your military, hone your strengths, discard your weaknesses. Do that, and the world shall tremble."

 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_title: "In Heaven and Halann"
 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_desc: "In the material world, our armies sweep all before them. With sabre and staff, sparkdrive and cannon, Taychend’s supremacy is won through blood and fire.\n\nIt is not enough. Make the Imperial Cult supreme, be that by canonisation or apotheosis. Then, we shall raise your ancestors, as gods or saints, to divine rulership. Soon, our glory will stretch across planes – and your blood shall rule in both Heaven and Halann."

 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_title: "An Empire Vainglorious"
 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_desc: "Our banners have conquered lands never seen before, our adventurers delved into ruins not uncovered in centuries, our artificers created weapons never tested. Our ambition knows no bounds. Our vainglory disregards the concept entirely.\n\nTaychend has risen, and it will rise further. We’ve unified one half of the continent – there’s only one path ahead of us now, and no going back. But you know that already, don’t you?\n\nGo forth, and make the world bleed."

 J84_3_12_echoes_of_ebenanth_title: "Echoes of Ebenanth"
 J84_3_12_echoes_of_ebenanth_desc: "Ebenanth, the First Emperor. Mere decades after the Ruin, with the glory of the Precursor Elves still in living memory, his singular will – and his possession of the Great Relic, Starshear – allowed him to piece Taychend back together. Then he was murdered by his officers, and by the end of the decade his achievements had turned to ashes.\n\nStarshear was torn apart, its shards distributed among Ebenanth’s assassins – and then lost over the years. But who knows? The echoes of Ebenanth remain amongst us still, and fragments of the past have returned before…"

 J84_3_13_the_last_city_title: "The Last City"
 J84_3_13_the_last_city_desc: "In Ebenanth’s shattered memories, you found a treasure that so many have aspired to, but that none have ever grasped – the tiniest hint, the barest scrap, of the location of Tacenie. And confirmation of its survival.\n\nThe last of the flying cities is real, it is intact, and it is in the Chendhya. We must find it, no matter the cost, no matter the time.\n\nAnd then? The discovery of Tacenie gives us an opportunity that has never before been within our reach… a chance to truly begin a new cycle, and cement our rule forevermore."

 J84_3_15_year_one_title: "Year One"
 J84_3_15_year_one_desc: "A millennium and a half ago, the flying capital of the Precursor Empire, Aesadas, fell. Death and ruin and terror, and the cycle of the Slaver Nobles ended. Taychend descended into the Cycle of Glory, as empire after empire attempted usher in the next age, dominated by their rule.\n\nYour line succeeded – and now, all that remains is for us to proclaim our rule, for all the world to see.\n\nWe WILL raise Tacenie – and with its fall, we shall rise above, the masters of a new Cycle! We shall claim our destiny once and for all, long awaited, by scholars and soldiers, emperors and warlords alike – and you shall be our instrument!"

 #Column 4
 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_title: "Suffer No Interloper"
 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_desc: "“Taychend suffers no interloper.” The origin of the saying is unknown, with three dozen cities claiming their local god-hero was the first to say it. That only points to the prevalence of the sentiment – the destiny of Taychend is for the Taychendi alone to control. Laskaris the Conqueror intervened in our affairs when he launched his invasion – and then the city-state he ruled attempted to destroy our way of life. That cannot be allowed to stand – Ameion, as well as the two smaller cities that provided aid to their cause, must be seized, and the Kheionai must be taught a lesson they will not forget."

 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_title: "The Rhythm of War"
 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_desc: "There is little more glorious than war. The rush of battle, the elation of seeing the enemy rout before you, as the red-rays of the blooded sun of victory settle, and the vultures circle over a field of the dead. The dance of battle, and the rhythm of war. The Taychendi know it like no other – and they know that few others excel at it like they do.\n\nThey are so good at it, in fact, that enough competing military doctrines and ways of war have sprouted up over the years that one Taychendi army is often very different to another – if we are to claim our glory, however, we must march to the drum-beat we know best…"

 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_title: "Titans of the Sea"
 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_desc: "The seas may be terrifying to most Taychendi, but with experienced Kheionai sailors now being drawn from our Cleaved Sea territories, and the powerful Degárikes, as well as new designs of sail and mast, designed for the open ocean, Taychend has the opportunity to become a maritime power as well as a great land power – if the empire is to truly become the master of Andeios, it must learn to become the master of the waves."

 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_title: "The Depths of Aercel"
 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_desc: "Nanru Nakar, the city of cities! By all accounts, it is the greatest and largest Precursor city still standing – built over, as it has been, by over a millennium and a half of slums and temples and Taychendi-made monuments.\n\nBeneath its surface lies the Underground, a colossal labyrinth of slave warrens, storerooms, ancient laboratories and who knows what else. Its upper levels, the Undercity, is inhabited by the scum of Nanru Nakar – but the lower levels, the Underwarren, is filled with all manner of danger. Nobody knows how far the Underwarren goes – how deep the Slaver-Nobles delved. Why don’t we find out?"

 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_title: "The Riches of the Past"
 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_desc: "We have uncovered relic sites across Taychend, and uncover more by the day. Now that we have unearthed the secrets of the past, it is time to turn them into riches, and develop the infrastructure that will begin to shape our future!\n\nWhile we use those relics to fuel our burgeoning native artificery, there is another use for the surplus artefacts we dig up. The Cannorians will pay exorbitant sums for our goods – should you secure the trade networks around us, we will surely grow ever richer from their desires."

 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_title: "Smoke and Steel"
 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_desc: "The Vanbury Guild were a valued trading partner, despite the morally questionable character of their directors. When they sought to stand against us, however, we had no choice but to destroy them – now, we possess the heart of their former direct holdings.\n\nThe VG were halfway into turning Tor Nayyi into an industrial hellscape, an entire island of smoke and steel, processing the resource-profits of western Aelantir. You need to finish the Guild’s job."

 J84_4_10_the_heart_hungers_title: "The Heart Hungers"
 J84_4_10_the_heart_hungers_desc: "Its chambers reliquary, its valves mechanical – with arteries of the slain, and veins of the fallen. The ruin-steel heart of Taychend beats ever faster, and the rhythm of war is its pacemaker.\n\nBlood is conquest. The world is full. The heart hungers.\n\nFill. It. Up."

 J84_4_12_beyond_the_storm_title: "Beyond the Storm"
 J84_4_12_beyond_the_storm_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nThe Precursors – some of our own ancestors among them – hid the greatest of their creations, the mighty, the terrible, the dangerous, behind the Kiamoa, an impassable wall of crashing lightning and powerful waves.\n\nBut the world is changing, and as our own power grows, the Kiamoa weakens. Send the order, and we will sail beyond the storm – Insyaa beckons, and its power awaits."

 J84_4_13_in_folly_opportunity_title: "In Folly, Opportunity"
 J84_4_13_in_folly_opportunity_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nCould there be any bigger failure than the Mechanim? Not their creation, no, but their dismissal. When the Precursors of Insyaa discovered that their creations were sentient – and we are under no illusion that they are not – they cowered from their creation, shut them down.\n\nBut we are not the Precursors. We are the Empire Vainglorious, and we know that before might, morality falters.\n\nFind them. Bring them back. Those who came before failed – but we will fulfil the Mechanim’s original design, no matter what it takes."

 J84_4_14_harder_better_faster_stronger_title: "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"
 J84_4_14_harder_better_faster_stronger_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nWhere the Precursors once cowered, we have thrown ourselves into the fray with every resource at our disposal. The true power of the Mechanim, greater than so many peoples in so many different ways, now lies in our hands.\n\nMost will be slaves, now and forever – but just as with the rest of our subjugated peoples, some will surely rise above, become warriors, generals, artists… and in time, warlords. So be it. Hook them into the Empire’s Ruin-Steel heart, and they will not only fulfil their original purpose, but surpass it – just as we have surpassed their ancient creators."

 #Column 5
 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_title: "We Will Make You Care"
 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_desc: "In good times, the Chendhyan steppe is far from the minds of most Taychendi rulers – those that have the luxury of ever being able to put the riders of the steppe out of their mind, that is. But as we grow in power, whispers stir of a gathering storm on the steppe, as the minor tribes of the Chendhya seek to challenge our power, and preserve their freedom. There are various groups who would like to see that challenge be furiously answered – perhaps it is time their calls were answered?"

 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_title: "Raiders of the Moon"
 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_desc: "There are few who are as good at raiding as the descendants of Munakles, or Munazhlan as they call him. Mounted on their feline cavalry, or else armed with the powers to move rock and soil itself, they have fiercely defended their freedom over the years by military means – but as our soldiers finally sweep over their lands, it seems their efforts are gradually coming to naught. That does not mean they cannot be useful, however – the Chendhyans of the Guaraddhi already adopted our ways once. Perhaps their cousins on the far steppe, and in the Mteibas valley, can be convinced to do a similar thing."

 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_title: "Monuments of the Water"
 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_desc: "Though the Taychendi have never truly been at home on the sea, the storms of the southern seas warding off most from straying away from sight of land, greed and glory both have turned the Taychendi to the waves time and time again, as trade with the Kheionai brings wealth back to Taychend – and the power of their great ships occasionally make themselves known.\n\nAfter Laskaris invaded Taychend, there were once more efforts to unlock the secrets of Kheionai naval power – and in the Degárikes, monuments of the water, so great and powerful it is a glorious endeavour to build one in itself, the key was found. Devand will soon fall – but if we are to invade Alecand, we must build a fleet of these ships, and finally beat the Kheionai at their own game."

 J84_5_5_the_hand_that_mocks_desc: "The Kheionai presumed to be superior to us. They eschewed worship of the gods in favour of mortal words and sayings, drinking their wine and carving their pretty statues. Our elites indulged in some of their ways, sure, importing Paraidar wine and Potidhano glass – but they never fell to their mindset. As they sat secure in their prison-cities, engaging in petty skirmishes and trade wars, we fought cataclysmic wars, storms of blood and fire. Laskaris thought he would bring their ways to us – instead, we will bring the storm to them, and show them what is truly the “superior” people."

They may not be superior, but it is difficult indeed to say they are not our near-equal, and that naturally means we must begin to treat them not as hostile enemies, but valuable subjects.\n\nThere is another option, though. A voice that says that today they are our near equal, and tomorrow they may prove they are more than that. A voice that says not to take the risk. Says to break them, once and for all… and to seize the hidden riches beneath their precious cities for our own gain. But we wouldn’t be so desperate to consume what we have so recently gained, ruin future territories, just to secure our power today, and gain temporary riches… would we?"

The acquisition of the Kheions and their knowledge, however, has given us a much clearer impression of Amadia, formed from the back of Oktikheion’s legendary Amadian Expedition.\n\nIt is a land of wild magic, fractured tribes, and silver and damestear beyond imagining. It seems we should have launched an Amadian Expedition of our own a long time ago – why don’t you rectify that mistake?"

Even though its people stand divided, weakened over the years by the trials of living in such a harsh land, the amount of the silver and damestear within their borders is truly astronomical.\n\nYou need to exploit not only these resources, but the untapped ones that we have not uncovered as well.

As our artificers crack open the secrets of the world, and our scavengers raise Ruin-Scrap from the graves of the past, we see a path to revival.\n\nA legion of Yodhans, shrouded in Ruin, armoured in antiquity.

 taychendi_empire_events.0.t: "Changing Style of Rule"
 taychendi_empire_events.0.desc: "It is normal for Taychendi rulers to model their reigns off those of past rulers, so that they have both a guideline for which policies to pursue in order to gain their own place in the heavens, and so that they can patronise a solid selection of rulers to help them do so. However, Mihaela is a vampire – possessing immortality, she will never see the gates of Dhivumanhu.\n\nInstead, her religious duty lies in her role of facilitating the apotheosis of her non-vampiric subjects. To that end, the style of her rule, and therefore the gods she patronises, encourages her subjects to follow that same path to apotheosis – naturally, switching up the style of her rule would be advantageous in dictating the direction of our empire."

 taychendi_empire_events.1.t: "Fate of the Chendhya"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.da: "The Grandmaster, kneeling, bowed his head low as he finished his appeal. The Bloodcloaks arrayed behind him in the throne room, faces hidden behind their plate-and-mail helmets, shrouded in capes of dark red cloth, bowed in unison as well. On the millennial anniversary of the Ruin, Olhokar the Fortuitous had received a similar appeal – to grant the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak stewardship of the Chendhya.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was flanked by two trusted warlords – Teshekar Takasangamar stood to one side, Andyzha Vakyrlana, of Darkalyndar, to the other. Teshekar leaned in first. “These elves are noble, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They guarded the frontier for centuries – even during Gophira’s fall, they upheld their sacred vows, never took sides! My family have sent many of our members to join their ranks – I know they’ll make good stewards, loyal and true.”\n\nAndzyha scoffed at that. “These Bloodcloaks are villains, renegades! Simply the worst people imaginable! They use their “vows” as excuses to terrorise innocent Chendhyans for fun – if “protecting the steppe” means riding around cutting tents, slaughtering livestock and whisking away women and children as slaves, then they “protect” very well indeed!”\n\n“Slander!” the Grandmaster called, as he rose to challenge Andyzha’s words. “We work only to protect Taychend from the Chendhyan hordes! For fun? You think we exact pleasure from our work?” When the warlord of Darkalyndar ostentatiously mouthed a “yes”, the Grandmaster drew the Greatsabre hanging on his back. “The steel of vengeance knows no pleasure, you barbarous, cat-riding whore–! I’ll have your–!”\n\n“Enough!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood suddenly, and the hall calmed at an instant. The Grandmaster shrunk back at the admonishment. “The Brotherhood’s appeal…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.db: "From Ebenanth Starshear’s Western Expedition, to the intervention of the Three Tribes in the Lanahine War, the pacification campaigns of the Mudaliar Empire, or Darakash Threadsworn’s stunning expedition through the steppe, Taychendi-Chendhyan history was as bloody as it was storied – and stagnant. Then, Ultarlan the Decimator arose.\n\nUltarlan united the Chendhyan tribes, and over the course of a decade conquered all Taychend. Though he was assassinated soon after, and his son Geladhlan – variously known as both “the Stoneburner” and “the Emancipator” – would fall victim to inter-tribal feuds, his empire collapsing with his death, the leftover Chendhyan kingdoms – Ezhudars – remained in power for decades. It would be these remnant kingdoms that would truly see Chendhyans adapt to Taychendi ways.\n\nBy the time Olhokar the Fortuitous rose and swept the remnant kingdoms away, a significant proportion of the Chendhyans in Taychend had adopted Taychendi religion, fighting wars for glory rather than simply defence. Most importantly, they had also adopted slavery – though they would never stoop so low as to enslave other Chendhyans, these “Chainforger” Chendhyans became active participants in the Andeiosian slave trade, selling Taychendi or Kheionai captives taken in raids to whoever would buy them.\n\nBe it the Ezhudar of Zaernmaera, who ravaged the Taychendi frontier in the early 1400s, Darkalyndar, who have served the Gophirans faithfully for centuries, or the Haebyziae tribe, who formed the backbone of Oremvand’s military, these Chainforger Chendhyans have proven themselves powerful and amenable to our ways time and time again. Perhaps we can cultivate this strength, and either give them more autonomy or sponsor the further adoption of Taychendi practices among their people?"

 taychendi_empire_events.2.d: "Alazhlan held tightly to the scruff of his feline mount’s dotted coat, as it deftly climbed the outcropping. When they had reached the pinnacle, he surveyed the army before him. Tens of thousands of Chendhyans had gathered on the plains, all for one purpose, all under his direction, and all for one reason. Alazhlan, Asadezheg of Saerraeg – the King of all Chendhyans – raised his sword towards the sky.\n\n“Chendhyans!” he called, and a roar unending answered, every mount and rider below crying out for freedom. “The slavers have united! A new empire of warlords has arisen – and they WILL seek to invade us! Destroy our way of life! Take our lives, our land, our freedom!” They always did – it was their nature, and had been from the days of the ancient Slaver-Nobles, and would be until the day they purged the vainglory from their hearts. That would not be this day, though – so instead, they would fight. “A hundred thousand elves and more march for the steppe – but will we stand by and watch as they subjugate us?”\n\nForty thousand elves answered in unison, their voices shaking the very earth – “Never!”\n\n“They are many, and we are few!” Alazhlan called. “But will we let that cower us?” “Never!” “Death awaits us! But will we let that break us!” “Never!” The Chendhyans raised their swords and spears towards the sky in defiance. “They want to buy our bodies with gold – but what will be our price?” “Blood! Blood! Blood!”\n\nAlazhlan beamed, even as the pit in his stomach deepened. He pointed his sword to the east – to Taychend, to death, to the end of everything they treasured. “Then ride with me, Chendhyans! Ride to war! Ride to vengeance! Ride to freedom!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.3.t: "Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"
 taychendi_empire_events.3.d: "As Seluslavi translated her owner’s words from Yodhanpir to Kalavendhi, Galinpan Kattyva threw his arms up in exasperation. “I’m not letting you have their city! I’m giving you half the population as slaves, their wealth, their livestock, even the warlord’s wife and children! What more could you want?” Seluslavi stole a glance at the aforementioned warlord on the other end of the table, staring straight ahead, despondent, while his overlord – the one supposed to be mediating – sold him out.\n\nThis was a Periyodhai – a semi-ritualised battle, with predetermined stakes, fought between two relatively equal vassals of a greater warlord. Everyone knew “Hurahara the Humungous” would win, though, so they were really negotiating his “prize”. She’d been the receiving end of one of these negotiations – the village star, a scholar destined for the Dumran Vustarvach. Now she was a slave, and she translated, and read her illiterate master stories, and provided him “comfort” when he demanded. And she longed for death, and never had the guts to seek it, and so Seluslavi translated.\n\nHurahara fumed, tried to control his rage for a second, then burst. “I WANT HIS CITY!” he boomed, as he slammed a fist down on the table so hard it nearly upended it. “I WANT HIS PEOPLE! I WANT THEM ALL!” The Kattyva didn’t need a translation to sigh in exasperation. It was easy to see what the Royakottari warlord desired. He had overextended himself in Yodhanchend looking for relics, and he wanted multiple reliable warlords to hold his lands there, not one ignorant brute called Hurahara the Humungous, whose neglect would ruin scavenging operations there for a generation.\n\nBut Hurahara was crazy, crazy, crazy, and he just didn’t care. The Kattyva finally gave in – and soon Seluslavi was translating that too. Hurahara seemed satisfied – Galinpan Kattyva silently counted up the costs of a military expedition. If the Kattyva won, she’d be sold off, taken by some saner lieutenant, maybe. Or she’d be killed when they took Hurahara’s home city. She’d like that. Tomorrow, she knew, the people in that warlord’s town would be wishing the exact same thing."

 taychendi_empire_events.4.da: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the Fateweaver’s chamber, he couldn’t help but be swallowed up by its majesty. The massive hall, carved deep into the hills, was bathed in the blue glow that emanated from the great damestear-jewel at its far end. Beneath it, at the apex of a pyramid of smooth-stone steps, hung the skeletal corpse of the Fateweaver – its arms outstretched and skull wrenched back, pierced with the relic-threads of prophecy, tendrils of ruin-steel that rose to the crystal above.\n\n“Beautiful, is it not?” the Threadbearer asked, as she walked up besides the Emperor. “We ought to go closer.” It took them a few minutes to reach the base of the stairs. Each step, Denariatam knew, was one taken by Darakash, Olhokar, Laskaris, countless conquerors and warlords and traders and politicians of ages past. They had each sought a glimpse of the future beneath the hills of Korrimutren – now, it was Denariatam’s turn.\n\nAs they reached the steps, the Threadbearer turned, motioned the Emperor to halt. “When I commune with the Fateweaver, I channel a power above any you could imagine. My own exceptional divination abilities are all that prevent a very gruesome death… do you know how to feel the future as I do?” Denariatam nodded, with the confidence only a powerful mage could muster. “Then step forth, and claim your destiny. I will wait here.”\n\nDenariatam ascended to the Fateweaver’s corpse. Her skeletal face was wrenched upwards – even worn to bone, he could see the agony of her final moments. The Emperor took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then placed his hand on the Precursor’s skull – immediately, unimaginable power surged through him. For a moment, he thought he had misjudged his strength, as the raw magics of an ancient being coursed through him, tore through his mind – then, his eyes snapped open, and he bore witness to a world beyond his own…"

 taychendi_empire_events.5.da: "Denariatam saw blurred images, snapping from one scene to the next. Armies marched through jungles, deserts, marshes, the Taychendi flag hoisted over cities of strange buildings – first some clearly Kheionai, then strange styles, with golden domes, smooth black spires, wooden cottages and honey-comb fortresses. Then back to Taychend – a scene on the Kalavend, blood soaked fields and broken bodies, with the Gathyanavaida tall in the background. A bolt from the astral whizzes through where it’s head would be, hurtling right towards the Emperor.\n\nDenariatam’s vision turned as if to run away – but a white-fanged shadow surprised him and pounced, its maw plunging him into darkness. The world was still for a moment – then there was a blinding burning light, a blazing sun rising and a sun-spot soldier within, wings sprouting from his back. He drew twin blades, and lunged.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam stared ahead at the Fateweaver’s corpse, frowning. “Strange new lands… and dangers in the dark. Blood and battle…” the corners of his lips crept upwards “...and glory. Strange new lands, and exotic new territories. Dangers from the dark, and dangers to be overcome.” Denariatam smiled."

After taking a moment to collect herself, she turned and descended the steppes silently, her face an unreadable mask.\n\n“So?” Denariatam asked tentatively. “What did you learn?” Was his empire to fall? Would he need to sacrifice his firstborn son? Would he be unkillable until he turned 61 years old? Or would he see unparalleled success? Glory and riches unrivalled?\n\nThe Threadbearer paused for a moment, her eyes moving to the sword at Denariatam’s hip. “Your armies will be uncountable, their advance unstoppable. Your empire will march to the ends of this world, conquer lands not yet seen by Elvenkind… but you will also fight enemies closer to home.” She looked up into the Emperor’s eyes. “Enemies await abroad – and daggers, of fanged teeth and shadow-shrouded steel, await you at home… waiting to strike, and waiting to take what they think is theirs.” The Threadbearer gave a little bow, her prophecy relayed, then began to walk back to the chamber.\n\n“Conquest, and steel, and daggers in the dark…” the Emperor said to himself, as he looked back to the great statue behind him.

He saw black ships sail high above – and then to the east, the gilded storm on the ground. He recognised them as his own people – as Taychendi. The strangers around him turned to watch – then turned to flee. But the wave overcame them. The scene changed – the world burned, the world bled. Now, Denariatam saw the apocalypse, blurred but so vivid, so real.\n\nCorpses were piled high, the blood pooled up to their ankles, millions, desecrated and defiled. Wood and stone burned and broke apart. Then he saw another city destroyed, then another, then five and ten and twenty more. Then a parade of shackled slaves, a hundred abreast, that stretched for miles and miles – they were each brutalised, bloody, missing limbs, blinded and wailing and retching and groaning. Denariatam realised he was not alone, for besides the slaves a gilded Emperor stood watching – one with his own face. When a brilliant blue light arose and bathed the bloodied world in its warmth, slave and emperor both turned to watch.\n\nTacenie rose above the horizon. Bright, glorious. The last relic of the past. Then it fell.\n\nEven a disembodied voice, Denariatam felt the heat and the power and the pain. The sounds of tens of millions screaming at once in terror. His double merely watched on, even as the Ruin-come-again flayed the skin off his face. He looked so, so proud\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “My Emperor!” the Threadbearer pleaded, steadying his fall. “You looked in such pain– I thought you weren’t going to make it! You must tell me, what did you see?” Only now did Denariatam notice the fast-paced beating of his heart, the sweat that drenched his body, the lingering burning sensation on his skin. The Emperor wrenched himself from the Threadbearer’s hand, and turned to leave."
 taychendi_empire_events.6.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. The rush of magic ceased in a heartbeat, as the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse. The Threadbearer did not move – it took a moment for Denariatam to realise something was wrong, and hurry up the steps towards her. Sweat dripped down the Threadbearer’s brow, as she stared still ahead at the skull before her – her eyes wide with terror. When Denariatam tried to rouse her, she turned startled, recoiled from his touch and stumbled back, falling to the floor. “What happened?” Denariatam asked. “What did you see!?”\n\nHer voice was tinged with horror. “Death! Death and terror and ruin! So much destruction, so much– by the gods, the blood! The screams–!”\nA chill went up Denariatam’s spine. “What did you see, oracle!? Whose blood, whose screams?!”\n“The world’s!” The Threadbearer cried. “My Emperor, the world’s! I saw men, women, children, thrown onto the pyres of their burning cities… hacked apart by sabre and shot, flayed alive by mage-fire! Black ships sailed, bays of chains and chattle, wailing, groaning– Taychendi, Kheionai, scaled monsters and green-hided brutes, whatever, whoever, it didn’t matter! The world weeping blood– by the gods, the crimes… the terrible crimes!” The Threadbearer threw her hands over her face to hide her tears.\n\n“Gods…” Denariatam muttered, “why must you toy with us so?” He stepped back, turned to the jewel above. Rage and terror mixed in his heart. “Damnable fate! You give us portents but no prophecy! WHAT MUST WE DO!?”\n“Tacenie…” the Threadbearer whispered. Denariatam’s head snapped back – the Threadbearer’s arms fell limply by her side. She looked off into the distance. “I saw Tacenie, rising above.” Then turned towards her Emperor. “And then it fell, and the flame of Ruin shattered the world. And you were watching, staring…"

Mages and tinkerers, most Taychendi but some strange, short or scaled, worked in laboratories, unearthed underground chambers, artefacts. He saw a kotakompu being pulled apart and reassembled in steel – the tortured beast noticed him and pounced. Then all dark – and the pulse of beating blood and whirring, crackling mana surged around him. Then the darkness cracked, and with the tearing of flesh and the whirring of steel, the walls of red-iron tore away – and a monster, a beast bigger than any the Emperor had ever seen before, revealed itself. It rose through the storm, reality warping around it’s immensity, incomprehension digging into Denariatam’s soul.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam wanted to say that he didn’t know. That he hadn’t the faintest idea. That the world was upside down and left was right. Then he took a deep breath, got a grip, and simply said whatever came to mind. “I suppose… I saw mechanical hearts and grinding gears, chambers reliquary and valves mechanical. I saw Taychend pulse with the damestear-blood of magic, the world torn apart by the ambition of… of…”\n\nDenariatam felt a presence behind him – though even as he turned, he knew there was nothing there.

And with mechanical hearts within, and the sound of grinding gears behind…?” The Threadbearer looked away from Denariatam – past him, as if whatever she had seen in the prophecy was behind the Emperor. “You will confront forces that will stretch comprehension itself.”\n\nThe Threadbearer shook her head as if to clear it, then turned back to Denariatam. “I am sorry, the communion was tiring… please, leave whenever you see fit.” Then she hurried off, and the Emperor was left alone – the past glowing bright before him, and the future towering high behind him."

And while they won glory, he’d been stuck at home, jewelling. Camnan looked down to his withered legs – and the wheeled chair that held them.\n\nThe jeweller heard a loud tut from behind him. “Each parade, I find you in such a state. Must you wallow in regret like so?” Camnan turned – Jalinwathi, the local priest of Elajith, and a member of the Violet Brotherhood, stood, arms crossed and a faint smile across his face.\n\nCamnan shrugged, frowning. “My friends win glory on the battlefield day by day – why, Varanran has slain so many foes he may well ascend! Meanwhile I’m stuck here… tinkering!” The jeweller looked to the parade again. “How am I supposed to attain glory if I can’t fight?”\n\n“The same way your sister’s writing grants glory, or old Trianran’s smithing – why, that elf made half the weapons used in that battle! You make wonders every month, and you still feel inadequate? Foolishness, Camnan, foolishness– there are many paths to ascension! And in Dhivumanhu, smith and soldier both drink from the same Pheni barrel!”\n\nCamnan scoffed. “Then why do we love war and battle so? The Empire marches east and west, north and south– how could you get more glorious than that?”\n\nNow it was Jalinwathi’s turn to frown. “Elvenkind has always craved the easy path. And blood and violence is easy… but sometimes it is being turned from the easy that allows one to seek the fulfilling.” The priest looked to the parade. “Perhaps Taychend will turn from the easy path one day…”"

The blue glow of magic erupted from the steel casing. The harsh glow turned his eyes to the sky above – and send a wave of unease rippling through him. Denariatam turned to the woman standing to his side, furiously scribbling in her notebook.\n\n“Are you certain we are safe, here?” Denariatam asked. “With the Windward gone– what if a storm strikes?”\n“We are safe,” Lelijitha Vustarin bluntly stated, not caring to look up from her notes. “We’ve done evacuation drills fifteen times… no, sixteen. Any residents will die, but our labourers will be safely in Ormam before any disaster strikes.”\nThe Emperor shook his head, as he turned back to the excavation. “Riches for us, fear for them, but it is ill-delivered – Degakheion was a proud city of glorious warriors. I should have chosen Oktikheion.”\n“And why did I counsel you otherwise?”\nDenariatam frowned. “Yes, yes, I know… my compunctions are exactly why it needed to be targeted. I see that, but even so…”\n\nThe Vustarin Matriarch finally looked up from her notebook. “The old Kheionai used to be mere prisoners of Tacenie, by my estimation. The Phylaxana were the last of their wardens. They clung to a long obsolete duty, a relic of the last cycle, just like – and forgive the slander – the Mudaliars. Unlike the Mudaliars, though, they used their ancestry to justify mocking the ways of all those opposed to them, even other Kheionai, like the Karkares they kept under “watch”. They never would have accepted our ways, and so they needed to serve as an example. Degakheion will remain forever a tombstone for Kheionai exceptionalism. A sign that our might, our fury, is more than equal to their “sophistication.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.11.db: "The Emperor of Taychend followed the artificers as they showed him their inventions outside Palaya Orenkoraim, the Gathyanavaida looming large in the background. A short fellow in a funny hat, “Sando Brassbottle”, led him around, as his assistants gave demonstrations of each invention. “Here– T-Wave transmitters, connects like lightning– oh, and speaking of lightning– sparkdrives! Any enemies? Bad doud? Pull the trigger and… toddo! Dead! And here... hmm, the “Maagikraftfayermaszeene”- thaumaturgical arcano-blaster cannon, yes? Supercharged a little, modified by me– it is… ah, not yet perfect, yes? Will backfire, mmm… 49.5% of the time? Needs a bit more “geelder” to fix, if you understand.”\n\nThe Emperor understood perfectly. The other weapons and inventions interested him, and greatly – but they were single-target weapons. He wanted devastation, and this arcane blaster thing looked like it could give him it. Denariatam pointed to the statue in the distance – and the palace where its head once stood. “Ebenanth, the First Emperor, decapitated that statue with a bolt from the Astral Sky. Precise annihilation – give me that, and I’ll give you more gold than you can imagine.”\n\nSando understood the assignment. He scratched his beard as he contemplated. “That… is difficult, yes… very difficult.” He called on his assistants, and they set to work modifying the canon, tinkering with the casing and the damestear within, aligning it perfectly – then, the gnome hooked up a string to a lever at the cannon’s back, and ordered those present to stand no less than 6.1 metres away. After a short countdown, Boltbrass pulled on the string and shouted “Danger-ho!”\n\nThe back of the blaster exploded. Half the artificers ducked for cover – but the Emperor was too transfixed on the magical bolt careening through the sky to care. It impacted the palace atop the Gathyanavaida and blew half of it into the sky. Denariatam’s breath caught – the power of Ebenanth replicated before his eyes. If this was the power of but a few Cannorian artificers, what could the Taychendi do with this technology?"

It was off the back of a Fateweaver-given prophecy that Darakash Threadsworn set off to the west, establishing a Taychendi “philosopher-kingdom” near Empkeios called Vadhipakvam, where he attempted to integrate Kheionai-inspired thinking into a Taychendi way of viewing the world.\n\nDarakash never truly fulfilled his dreams, however. His expedition had left carnage in its wake, and the incensed Chendhyans rallied against this new invader – not twenty years after its founding, Ultarlan the Decimator destroyed Vadhipakvam. Few Taychendi survived – none made it back home.\n\nBut times have changed. The Chendhya is pacified for good, and we now control the entirety of a land synonymous with philosophical thinking. Many are calling for us to attempt to recreate Darakash’s dream in our Kheionai territories, with this new Vadhipakvam promoting a mix of Taychendi philosophies that will better serve their new subjects – and therefore allow them to better serve our empire. Others still call for us to simply better garrison our Kheionai territories, and attempt to integrate them through might and power, rather than words and reason. Ultimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."

Well…” a slave passed the Vustarin a series of papers – she rolled them out on the desk, revealing a series of city plans. “The location or supposed location of the Zopedan cores in each of the Kheions – we did a little investigating before Degakheion was agreed upon, just in case, but now that we know what they look like, how you can scrap your way to finding them…? Well, Arpedifér’s core is the only one that still eludes us, but we’ll get there – other than that only problem comes in clearing out the areas we need to excavate.”\n\nDenariatam nodded as he stared at the papers on the meeting table. The moment he laid his eyes on the final figures from the excavation of Degakheion’s windward, his mind was set. The wealth they had dug up from those cities was simply astronomical… how could he resist the opportunity to replicate that success six times over?\n\n“My Emperor?” Denariatam looked up. “I think you’re asking the wrong questions.” The Vustarin Matriarch put Oktikheion’s city-plan to one side, and unravelled a map of the Cleaved Sea. “It isn’t whether we’ve prepared to excavate – it’s if you’ve prepared for what comes next. The Kheionai will rise in revolt… and if I had to guess, it would all Kheionai, everywhere. And the world will look on us like– well, we’d be pariahs for a time, I’m sure.”\n\nThe Emperor furrowed his brow. “I didn’t expect you to question my morality.”\n\n“Not your morality,” the Vustarin pointed at Empkeios on the map, “your troop deployments. Threzaranthi Uyasmar would do more good in Oktikheion than Empkeios, and the Rakulacans… well, let’s just say this is going to take a lot of bloodshed, and they’ve proved good at it.”"

Were we able to control this process, we could have a tighter grip on Taychendi religion than anyone has ever known.

The northern jungle has many resources at its disposal, with monstrous fauna and vine-slave Seedthralls proving themselves more than a match for our regular soldiers – and to make matters worse, the Effelai has made a nasty habit of turning our dead into their puppets.\n\nWe have a solution to our plight, though – artificery. Our innovation knows no bound, and with our tinkerers and engineers crafting every manner of war machine, so too will our capacity for destruction. The only question is to what extent shall we unleash this new technology?

Ahead of her was whatever remained of her family and friends – behind her was death. Her village had already been consumed, incinerated by the iron-masked elves and their jets of flame. If not for Ishere’s quick thinking, Eestra would have been consumed as well.\n\nBut the fire wasn’t all she needed to worry about. A bull-like beast charged from the darkness, sent by the jungle maybe, straight at the wall of fire. One second Ishere was running for her life – the next she flying through the air. A snap cut her cry short. Eestra screamed, sprinted over to her sister, turned her over. She ignored the lifeless look in her eyes, tried to shake her awake anyway. Then nothing, and she screamed again, and she hugged her sister’s corpse tight to her chest, and began to wail. Her next scream was one of pain, not grief, as the fire claimed her, and her skin crackled and boiled, and every nerve in her body was set alight and torn apart.\n\n– – –  \n\nUnatam tried to hold the Auto-Scorchray level, as he wrested with the cord that tied it to a Damestear core behind him. Each step was deliberate, in time with the heat-masked elves to his left and right – so long as they kept the formation, the Effelai’s beasts couldn’t make it past them. He was concentrating, focused – then, he saw something emerge from the wall of fire.\n\nAt first he thought it was a scorched tree stump – but as he marched forwards, unable to take his eyes off it, he began to understand what it was. A Effelai native holding another in her arms. Mother and daughter, maybe, now charred bone and blackened flesh. For a heartbeat Unatam felt shame – then he replaced it with rage.

And now, they gathered once more.\n\nThey lined up here to kneel before him – to prostrate themselves before the Emperor and proclaim their loyalty, shower him with gifts – and when they died, their heirs would come to kneel as well, and their heirs after them. It was an ingenious system, one that forced each major warlord of the realm to bow to the Imperial power, one that reminded them of their true place in the world.\n\nThe Tailatam System, it was called. Amidst the death throes of the Second Gophiran Empire, its progenitor, Tailatam Sangamar, had employed it to great effect in the lands he controlled, binding the warlords of the Kalavend to him while he turned his attention to winning the civil war. It didn’t save Tailatam in the end, as assassins of the Na’Cailana slaughtered his advisors and generals, and left his movement in the dirt – but the Taialtam System signified the final form of Gophira’s hegemonic aspirations. The final step in their plan to make their rule over Taychend eternal.\n\nDenariatam Rakulacan would fulfil that plan. Here, they would kneel – and out there, they would obey. The warlords had enough power already, over his actions, over the Empire’s future, but he would not allow them to control the Emperor’s future – and he would not allow those who rejected that right to persist into the future either. He noted the tens of thousands there – and felt the hundreds not. But they would be crushed, in due time.

It was more a dance than a duel, as Tesharanthi Takasangamar and Elvaratam Sharadan threw everything they had at each other. Both were masters of the sabre, but while Elvaratam wielded twin blades whirlwind-like, Tesharanthi’s true power was the technicolour cape on his shoulder, enchanted to high heaven and nearly impervious to attack. Tesharanthi wielded it half a buckler, half a matador’s cloak, its defensive value only improving his aggression. Absolute offence vs perfect offensive-defence – no wonder a hundred thousand Taychendi had turned out to watch.\n\nThe Emperor couldn’t help but be enraptured himself – but he wasn’t just taken in by the duel. This fight was the culmination of decades of political feuding between Kattisangamar and Sibisimra. The feud between Elvaratam and Tesharanthi had begun to draw in other warlords – so Emperor Denariatam decided to bring it to its conclusion. Now, in the heart of the Mavihanavao, the core of Nanru Nakar’s martial legacy, the two feuding warlords could finally fight it out.\n\nThe crowd grew wilder as the fight progressed – as Elvaratam tired against Tesharanthi’s peerless defence. Denariatam could see the Mudaliar Cousins on the other side of the box excitedly discuss the battle below. It was their family’s ancestor who had inspired this. As the first Mudaliar Emperor had once said, “it is not the Emperor’s duty to impede the glory of their subjects, and it is not their duty to stand by. It is their duty to channel, to uplift – to sit up on the High Chair, and make themselves violence’s protector, and vainglory’s pride.”\n\nThe Takasangamar made a mistake – a small slip, a miss, and the exhausted Elvaratam pounced like the bandit he was. There was a tornado of steel, and in a heartbeat Tesharanthi was at his opponent’s mercy. The crowd erupted, even as the Emperor rose to proclaim the outcome."

The warlords at his side were telling him something, but the words went in one ear and out the other. He had been at the forefront of the conflict, at the wall of flame that had put the Effelai to flight – and then slain it. For months, the Emperor had lived in a world of smoke-choked skies and roaring fires, bloodied vines and mud-soaked steel. The war against the Effelai was fought in darkness – but now, he saw its aftermath in the light of day.\n\nBefore the war, the Effelai had been a forest of tall canopies, webs of vine and silk and exotic plants and flowers, the green of the leaves fighting with red and pink and blue for dominance. Now, the ground was covered in a field of light grey, ash carpeting the soil like snow. And with the towering trees that had once blocked sun and sight gone, replaced with twisted, charred, hulking husks, it was if the whole of the Effelai was laid out before him. A forest of blackened stumps, each a tombstone to the singing jungle, that went on for miles and miles and miles.\n\nSomething caught the Emperor’s eye – Denariatam halted, looked down at his feet. A green shoot sprouted through the ash. “The Effelai…” Denariatam asked, a chill running down his spine. “It’s gone? Completely?”\n\nThe warlord to his side raised an eyebrow. “My Emperor… that’s what I was telling you about, sir.” Denariatam just stared at him blankly – the warlord started again. “We believe it has been crippled. The Seedthralls are all gone, any above ground presence has been incinerated… but some of the roots near the Heart are still alive. We’ve been burning them when we can, but…”\n\nDenariatam laughed. All this, and it still persisted! They had burned the world, burned half the continent, and it still survived! The Emperor shook his head. “No, no– we’ve had enough burning.

Everywhere, elves ask “why?”\n\nSome also ask “how?” They lay the blame at the Emperor Denariatam’s feet, and accuse him of having blood on his hands and ash on his boots. Many of the warlords agree.\n\nBut that cannot be allowed to persist. Taychend has been beaten before – but we will not allow our Northern Expedition to become Ebenanth’s Western Expedition. This will not be our downfall, merely a setback in Taychend’s ultimate destiny.\n\nThe war drums beat once more, the sabres are sharpened, the fire is reignited.

THEY’LL BURN– BUURRRRNNNN–!”\n\nThe lead engineer – one Galinpan Arihnai – gave a hearty laugh at the captive’s threat. “As you can see, the demon gets rather angry stuck in there.” The lead engineer stepped towards the turret’s “nozzle”, making sure to keep his head out of the way. “In fact, that is the secret to our system here, my Emperor – a jet of flame, available on demand! Allow me to demonstrate.” One of Galinpan’s assistant artificers handed him a heavy, padded cowl – after he put it on, the lead engineer moved his head before the nozzle for a split second.\n\n“BUURRRRNNN–!” came the cry, and then a roaring jet of flame erupted from within. The top of Galinpan’s cowl singed, but the artificer came away otherwise unscathed.

He grimaced as that enemy walked through the broken door, wielding a massive handheld cannon. The Techno-Warlord pointed it as Sajirada.\n\n“How lucky I am,” Daranarma started, “that you were not killed on the field yesterday! I’ve gotten a lot more testing out of my new weapon!” He had a satisfied grin on his face that made Sajirada’s blood boil. “This–” he turned his cannon to show the rainbow-like crystal that powered it, “-is prismatic damestear, straight from Amadia!” He had heard of these things – powerful but wild, chaotic. ”It packs a punch, my friend– want to see!?”\n\nThe Techno-Warlord levelled the cannon at the seated warlord – as the barrel began to glow with prismatic light, Sajirada readied himself for the end. But when the weapon fired, it was not Sajirada who was claimed by it. An explosion of prismatic light erupted from the back of the weapon – and the right half of Daranarma’s upper body exploded with it. The Techno-Warlord flew through the air, alongside a shower of giblets and gore. His mutilated corpse hit the floor with a wet thump.\n\nDaranarma’s men looked at the corpse, then at each other, and then broke, fleeing. Sajirada could hardly believe his luck.

As far as we understand, the Effelai used the same processes it employed to encourage the growth of its plants and roots to encourage the growth of its animate creations.” The artificer gestured to the elf in the testing chamber, seemingly sedated. “By taking those processes and introducing them to our own subjects, we believe we can replicate the Effelai’s… creative abilities.” An assistant entered the testing chamber, jabbed some sort of needle in the ruinborn’s neck, then rushed back out. The door slammed behind him.\n\n“We’ve tried it on plants, kotakompu, oxes.” The ruinborn jerked awake – then began to writhe around in pain. “All trials were… highly effective.” There were gasps in the observation chamber as tumours seemed to sprout across the subject’s body, his muscles bulging, expanding. Muffled screams could be heard from behind the iron-barred glass, as cords of muscle sprouted from the elf’s body – red at first, though they quickly turned green. Flowers sprouted from the vine-like tendons. “Muscle growth was particularly exceptional.”\n\n“He does not seem controllable,” the Emperor commented, as the test subject slammed his head against the ground repeatedly. Blood and bone splattered across the chamber floor.\n\n“Oh, “he” will expire soon,” the artificer admitted, “the real issue is controlling the subject’s corpse. As with the growth serum, we needed to rely on the Effelai’s own methods.” He turned to one of his assistants and gave a command – soon, a siren-like song could be heard from beyond the glass. The ruinborn snapped out of his frenzy immediately, even as his body continued to tear itself apart – as the song changed, he stood, swaying to the rhythm.\n\nOne of the warlords in the room turned to the Emperor, horror written across his face. “To subject living beings to this monstrosity is– it’s an insult to all who died fighting the Effelai! We fought to destroy that thing, not revive it! How could you–” The Emperor cut him off with a glare."

 taychendi_empire_events.26.t: "Plant Misbehavin'"
 taychendi_empire_events.26.d: "When we began “producing” imitation Seedthralls, we believed them to be easily controllable shock troopers. When we began to introduce Effelai growth stimulants into some of our agricultural fields, we foresaw all positives and no drawbacks, our crops growing taller and fatter than they ever had before. Both of those assumptions, it seems, were misguided.\n\nThe Effelai was complex beyond imagining, its true nature likely known only to those who had created it – or, at least, observed it in its initial stages. With the Effelai defeated in its home territory, cut down to a few scraps clinging to its heart, we thought we could harness its near-corpse, and effectively lifted the methods it had used to expand wholesale. Unfortunately, we seem to neglected just how much of the old singing jungle we would be bringing forwards.\n\nAcross our empire, it seems that the various Effelai-influenced plants and Seedthralls have been taken back under the control of the remnant Heart, and are now going berserk, with plants rapidly spreading and consuming farmers and villagers alike, and our imitation Seedthralls rampaging across the land. While we have desperately tightened the security around the Heart of the Effelai so that this does not happen again, we will still have to clean up the out of control plants."

 taychendi_empire_events.27.t: "Of Strength and Honour"
 taychendi_empire_events.27.d: "The chieftain fell to one knee as the fight finally left him. Cuts and bruises covered his body – and the Emperor Denariatam’s. The fight had taken everything both of them had, as sabre, shield and warhammer clashed, an audience of tens of thousands of Ozgar Orcs and Taychendi watching on. The Emperor himself felt half-dead, bones cracked and blood and sweat mixing as they dripped down his face – but even still, it was his sabre that was aimed at the orcish chieftain’s neck. Denariatam had won.\n\nThe chieftain looked up, straight into the Emperor’s eyes. “You bested me… a good fight, but you bested me…” the orc smiled despite himself – they had given both their peoples a show they would not soon forget. “Congratulations… chieftain.” The smile wore away as the Taychendi in attendance cheered, and the orcish now-ex-chieftain understood exactly what he had lost. This was an Ozarm Chadash – and now, Emperor Denariatam found himself the undisputed master of all orcs in his realm. The Taychendi elf took his sword away, and turned to the crowd.\n\nThe orcs had looks of existential fear written on their faces. Their existence hinged on his decision now. Many of the warlords wanted to “repossess” the orcs – apparently created by Ducaniel, the scion of Aesadas, so recently rediscovered but already regarded with a mix of awe and derision. Some of those wanted to put them to work in the mines and plantations, as the Cannorians had done – but was that not a waste of their martial abilities? Others wanted to induct them into a specialised force of auxiliaries, send them as shock troops against our enemies. There were those still that wanted to simply leave them alone. Had they not suffered enough?\n\nDenariatam supposed he was the judge of that, now. He called to the crowd – “Orcs of Taychend…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.28.t: "The Power of Yodhan"
 taychendi_empire_events.28.d: "The Sajirada’s jaw dropped as he walked into the entrance hall – one of his bodyguards retched as they saw the carnage. The corpses of his soldiers were strewn about, mutilated, ripped apart, smashed in. Blood pooled across the floor, spattered the walls. It was like some terrible beast had rampaged through – and had left a horrific trail of death and devastation in their wake, that continued all the way through the Sajirada base. They’d done well for themselves since their late patriarch Jalinta had turned them into feared Techno-Warlords, expanding their territory, their influence, their manpower. Now, something had turned all that inside out – hundreds had been killed, and seemingly without any casualties.\n\nFinally, Sajirada and his men came to his throne room. The trail of blood and gore led right up to the golden chair at it’s head, the twenty corpses that surrounded it – and the armoured figure that sat atop it. The armoured elf was seven feet tall, covered head to toe in jagged Precursor-steel plates, Damestear glowing beneath them. The hulking figure stood up, and cracked its knuckles.\n\nThe Techno-Warlord ordered his soldiers forwards – and then watched in horror as they were torn apart. Gunfire, sabre slashes, magic bolts, all had no effect. The steel plates, already coated in gore, were painted a deeper red. Finally, only Sajirada was left. The armoured figure advanced, swiped the warlord’s weapon away, and threw him to the floor. It stood over him – then the figure removed their helmet.\n\nThe warlord stared in disbelief. Towering over him was the face of Selurana Vustarin – the fifty-something, bookish matriarch of the Vustarin family had torn through an entire army. “That’s impossible! What is this– this power!?”\n\n“I believe,” the Vustarin gloated as she readied the killing blow, “this is the power of Yodhan! And to think, it took a Thekvrystana to finally unlock it– and some Larankarha to test it on!”"
 taychendi_empire_events.28.a: "The Matriarch laughed maniacally as she turned the Sajirada’s head into pulp."

 taychendi_empire_events.29.da: "Denariatam took another sip of wine as he looked out from his balcony, at the immensity of his capital below. It was night, but even now the light of commerce, industry and empire illuminated the light’s sky. Taychend never truly slept anymore. The carts never stopped, the harvest never ended, the war-banners never unfurled.\n\nHe should be happy, he knew – but he could only grimace as he thought about the empire he ruled. They had surpassed the greatest empires of the past long ago. They surpassed them the moment they unified Taychend, really. Denariatam knew now that his dynasty would not fall as the others did. His empire would conquer, and the warlords would hunger, and on the blood of the world they would feed, the ichor of their ascension.\n\nThe cart of empire was running, running… faster yet faster, straight ahead, destined for the wall named “ETERNITY” – the true end of the Cycle of Glory. The beginning of a new age, where Taychend would rule undisputed. It was unstoppable. It was uncontrollable. And if they looked beyond the wall and did not like what they saw? Or if the wheels were running off fate’s track, towards somewhere nobody could even comprehend?\n\nWell, there was Deniaratam could do about it anymore. He took another sip from his wine, closed his eyes. The hum of Empire, and the screams of the conquered, and the cry of “glory! Glory! Glory!” droned on – as it did, as it had, as it would. Already, his lieutenants were drawing up plans for new expeditions, to North Aelantir, to Insyaa, to Sarhal. The Emperor knew his realm would go further. An empire for a day, an empire for an eon, it did not matter – Taychend will rise, an Empire Unstoppable, an Empire Ascendant, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.devil: "Denariatam took another sip of wine as he looked out from his balcony, at the immensity of his capital below. It was night, but even now the light of commerce, industry and empire illuminated the light’s sky. Taychend never truly slept anymore. The carts never stopped, the harvest never ended, the war-banners never unfurled.\n\nThe Emperor closed his eyes – and in his mind he saw images of conquest, of glory. The sounds of battle, steel clashing, flesh rending, warriors calling battle cries as the gore-covered and yet-still-glorious fallen cried for mother or mercy or malevolence’s brand of justice. And the blood… all the blood. Even as he mused on the realm he ruled, his subordinates arranged new campaigns in North Aelantir, in Sarhal, in Insyaa. From the warlord to the warrior to the wretched slave, Taychend hungered – and it satiated itself on the blood of the world.\n\nDenariatam downed his wine-cup – savoured the purple-red trickling down his throat. Why did blood satiate Taychend? Why had the other empires not realised this, not conquered the world to sustain themselves? He used to ask these questions. Then, like Valkadevu on the wastes of Neraghul, he understood. The other empires had simply misunderstood – glory is not some ambiguous thing. Glory is Violence.\n\nIf the Emperor would not kill, end, conquer, annihilate then the warlords would do it for them. And so you be the sword, or face it. And so Taychend would march, and destroy, and drink the blood of the unconquered world until they could drink no more. Then? Maybe they’d all turn on each other, rend the Empire apart for the ichor of ascension that pumped through its veins. It didn’t matter. The Cycle of Glory – the Cycle of Blood – would be over, and Taychend would have already ascended. An Empire of Violence, and an Empire Vainglorious..."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dvampire: "Mihaela strolled through her trophy room in Nanru Nakar, inspected the glass cases. They were filled with the greatest relics and keepsakes of the Taychendi Empire – a who’s who of every threat this realm had ever faced. She’d only faced down a fraction, but it didn’t matter. This empire was hers – and that meant its victories, its glory, and its valour were all hers too. The Kamrayakval’s Armour, ever black and imposing; an Erythe mist generator from the Red Halls of Degakheion; a prismatic idol from Amadia; the preserved body of a Seedthrall; the green-flamed sword of Munakles… it was her property. Her right..\n\nShe stopped at the display that held Laskaris’ helmet and armour,  The armour was a forgery – a replica forged by a smith from Banderuttai – but if it looked right, and felt right, who really cared? The helmet was definitely real, though. Mihaela took the armour out sometimes, wore it around, tried it out. She could almost feel the confidence drip from the steel – see Laskaris’ victories play out before her. It was funny how knowing when you’d die could be so similar to immortality.\n\nBut that was the trick, she supposed. The “why” behind the Taychendi first accepting her and lauding her, cheering as she sent them to conquer the ends of the world. Who cares about the specifics? Who cares that your Empress drains the blood of a few innocents to survive, when your Empire consumes millions to keep afloat? Who cares if your ruler is foreign, when they rule just as a native would? Why care about controlling others when it gives you the ultimate freedom?\n\nMihaela sighed, turned and sat against the glass – hoped for a moment that she’d have figured this all out a few centuries ago. But then she shook away that regret. If she had joined her child in his goal, she’d have joined him in defeat just the same – now, she had everything he had wanted and more. She personally controlled the greatest empire in the world. She could do whatever she wanted… and there were a lot of things she wanted to do. And so Mihaela rose – and with her, the empire. An empire of blood, an empire of chaos, an empire of order…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dlarankar: "Denariatam looked at the armour before him – plates of precursor steel covered mail, elegant and imposing all at once. It was the armour of Erankar, the armour that the Emperor-Defiant had worn as he cleaved Fate’s puppet-strings, and carved an Empire from anarchy. Since then, Larankar had given Taychend victory after victory, the borders expanding beyond any previous Taychendi realm. He should be happy – but Denariatam could only grimace as he thought about the empire he ruled, as the so-called “Warlord-Autonomous.” \n\nDenariatam knew now that his dynasty would not fall as the others did. His empire would conquer, and the warlords would hunger, and on the blood of the world they would feed, the ichor of their ascension. The cart of empire moved faster yet faster, straight ahead, destined for the beginning of a new cycle, where Taychend would rule undisputed. It was unstoppable. It was uncontrollable. And if he looked beyond this cycle and did not like what he saw? Or if the wheels were running off imagining’s track, towards somewhere he could not comprehend?\n\nDeniaratam professed total autonomy – he wanted to believe Erankar had cut fate’s cord long ago. But he knew that no matter what he did, the hum of Empire and conquest and glory would drone on – as it did, as it had, as it would. Already, his lieutenants were drawing up plans for new expeditions, to North Aelantir, to Insyaa, to Sarhal. He desired these things – but could he afford not to? Or was he a slave, destined to be but a cog in a machine with one destination? The conquest of the world – then disaster?\n\nHe could only see one answer, and it weighed on him far heavier than Ruin-steel. An empire for a day, an empire for an eon, it did not matter – Taychend would rise, an Empire Unstoppable, an Empire Ascendant, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dgophira: "The Sangamar King smiled as he looked out over the desert. He was standing where Olhokar had once sacrificed his eldest son to save Gophira. He had not known how successful he was – for in saving Gophira, he had saved first the greatest empire of Taychend, and then the greatest empire since the Precursors.\n\nThe Gophiran Empire now stretched from the cities of the Triarchy to the coast of Soruin, from the sand-blasted wastes of Alecand to the plains of the Dry Coast. Taychend had far surpassed the heights of prosperity they reached under the Second Empire. The Ironblood Army was so large as to be uncountable, so powerful as to be undefeatable. By subsuming the warlords, and then unleashing them on the world, the Sangamars had seemingly dominated them. While its borders and buildings expanded, the Third Gophiran Empire was unstoppable.\n\nBut Denariatam knew that blood was like poison to metal – and bloodlust could be poison to his empire. There was a point, halfway through the Second Empire, that it seemed nothing could stop the turning of the Cycle, Gophira’s final victory. Then, Gophira proved that it could stop that victory all by itself. The Second Empire collapsed into a death-spiral of civil war. When the Third Empire’s borders could expand no further, would Gophira’s army then turn inwards for a new source of glory?\n\nThe Emperor sighed. He supposed that was a question for his descendants – for now, it was all he could do to make sure Gophira did not falter, that it would rise, an Empire of Iron, an Empire Eternal…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dsthanan: "Denariatam stared emptily at the wine-cup on his desk – he sighed, then downed its contents. The entire day he had been locked inside his study in the Violet Library, pouring over old histories, thinking and thinking. He had read of the old empires of Taychend, of the first Dumrusvarn – and the more he read, the deeper the pit in his stomach grew.\n\nEletam, the golden warrior, Elajith, the violet scholar… surely they could not have foreseen that this would have happened? It was as if all their wishes had been granted, but in the worst possible way. More tales of glory, of all kinds, were published in the Violet Library by the year, but their words were written in blood. The Goldswords brought order to Taychend, but they did so by sending off the warlords to ravage distant lands. Magnificent cities were built, but they were paid for with the looted treasures of a hundred civilisations.\n\nHe could see where this was leading. One day, the borders of the Dumrusvarn would encompass the world, with half of its realm a blasted waste. Taychend would be a glorious beacon of civilisation, built atop the corpses of hundreds of millions. And then the warlords, their desire for battle and conquest insatiable, would turn on him.\n\nDenariatam shook his head, stood, walked over to the nearby balcony so he could look once more over his city. He could do nothing to stop it – he knew that. But the cycle needed to turn from one of chaos, to one of order. If the warlords believed glory is violence, so be it – the Dumruktams had figured out it was so much more a long, long time ago. As the Emperor looked out over the city, he could see the bright lights of learning, and culture, and industry. One day, they would be the Goldsword’s saving grace against the blooded storm – Taychend will rise, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dnakar: "The three cousins stared at the tomb in silence. They had spared no expense on the construction of their ancestor’s resting place, a mausoleum of richly painted marble and lapis-tiled stone. A great statue of Liandarha had been built behind the sarcophagus, cast in gold and Precursor steel, her famous bright orange hair replicated in fire.\n\nVatasheran Kriadvai-Mudaliar placed his hand on the stone. “Do you think she would be proud of us?”\nThe Queen of Kilaiek raised an eyebrow. “Why wouldn’t she be?” Galichana replied, incredulous. “She ruled Nanru Nakar – we rule half of Aelantir. If she saw us now, she’d smile upon us!”\n\n“Would she?” both cousins looked to the Emperor as he spoke. “Liandarha was an elf of Tacenie, but the warlords of our Empire look to the Slaver-Nobles she despised. Liandarha won this city off a slave revolt, while this Empire secured itself by destroying one. Do you think she’d like the bloodshed, the constant warfare?”\n\n“She was a warrior!” Kilaiek replied. “Of course she would!”\n“How could we know?” Kriadvai responded.\n“Does it matter?” Denariatam asked. The other two cousins looked askance at him. “It’s been over a millennium since she lived – and in that time, this city, this family… we’ve grown. Evolved. The way we rule those below, sitting up on the high chair, above the warlords – that was not Liandarha’s vision, that was Varanash’s! The way we rule ourselves, split into three and then rebound – that was not Liandarha’s vision, it was the vision of Triandar and Elechana and Pelozhil!”\n\nDenariatam looked up at the statue. “Liandarha was born amidst the skies, tethered to the light and order of Dhivumanhu… but she died in darkness, in a world of glorious chaos. That is the world in which we live and over which we reign… and it is through glory, and through chaos, that we shall end this cycle, and return the glory of Liandarha’s age to Aelantir. We will rise, an Empire Vainglorious…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.30.t: "The Speech at Teramzadai"
 taychendi_empire_events.30.d: "Munatam had stood alongside a hundred thousand soldiers that day, on the fields of Teramzerai. A force commanded by the greatest warlords of the Empire, and led by the Emperor himself, a grand invasion force that would soon set off for the lands of the Lizardfolk. The Emperor gave a speech, elucidating the higher purpose of the war. He talked about how the Precursors had once sundered the Lizardfolk, “usurped the golden scales”, burned their civilisation to the ground, and how by repeating and surpassing their conquests they could prove they had matched the might of Tacenie and Aesadas. When the Emperor was finished, Munatam cheered, chanting “glory!” alongside the rest of the army.\n\nBut in his tent that night, Munatam turned to his comrade as they were getting ready to sleep. “Ishran…” he said, “did you understand the speech today?”\n“Not a word,” the Chendhyan replied, chuckling. “Do you know who Ae-sa-das is?”\nMunatam shrugged. “A flying city I think? That’s what Tacenie was. But I don’t get how this is supposed to be any more glorious than a normal war. I mean, in this “Golden Scales” thing, the lizards had a big empire… but they’re now divided, weaker than they would have been… right? And the Slaver-Nobles… was it even difficult for them? Surely we would need to–”\n\n“Ah, Munatam!” Ishran cut him off in exasperation. “Stop wasting time thinking about things that don’t matter. We’re here to fight battles, kill people, and loot everything or everyone not nailed down. That’s our glory– what more do you need?”\nMunatam shrugged, looking down. “Well… I don’t know. Just wanted to understand, that’s all.”\n\nIshran laughed at that. “Believe me, Munatam – you probably understood the speech better than the person who gave it!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.31.d: "“The city took a few weeks to take, but that was expected. Hard fighting, but quite a few good duels, glorious moments – I attached a list for you of the relevant regiments, soldiers, warlords, in case you wanted to celebrate any. Also seized massive stocks of psychoactive substances, Marhed Rayodana will love the stuff. About half the city dead, the rest enslaved. About a hundred thousand bound for Taychend. Lizardfolk are good swimmers though, and when we’re still near shore some try and jump overboard – requesting some more gunners to counter.”\n– Denarion Vitakes, Siege of Nazhni Report\n\n“There were a few snags. The lizards conjured up a storm on approach. By the time we got there, the troops were riled up. We took the city fine, but then the soldiers got off the leash – I tried to restore order, but when they started smashing up all the egg clutches things got messy. I just gave up after a while. I’ll write a full report later, but about 90% dead? Blood flowing down the streets etc. etc. The rest either escaped or were caught by us. We didn’t take many casualties, though – and we stripped the city clean. I directed a shipment of sapphires directly to the Palace, as you had instructed.”\n– Ultatam Achyavar, Siege of Khugra Report\n\n“Heavy use of evocation magic and artificery employed, similar instruments to that used in the Effelai. TOO SUCCESSFUL. Floating harbours incinerated in an hour, ZERO slaves recovered. Will need to dredge metal, gold from the water. Rest of the city put up too much resistance, lost control of soldiers. Captured 10 to 20 thousand slaves, rest killed, mostly by fire. 200, 300 thousand? The city census you gave me was probably exaggerated. I told you Auto-Scorchray is OVERKILL for urban environments. No historical/distinguished duels, events of note. Karassk champions all piles of ash – good job!”\n– Arichanna Vustarin, Siege of Karassk Report."

 taychendi_empire_events.32.t: "The Second Usurpation"
 taychendi_empire_events.32.d: "Denariatam grimaced as he looked at the spire across the lake, a lance of black stone piercing the sky. The remnants of another ancient empire, whose power went beyond his comprehension. The ancient Lizardfolk had apparently had the strength to conquer other worlds, travel through the Astral Sky. If these spires were how they did it, then they may well soon find out how – at great expense, the technology within the spire had been stripped out, and shipped off to Taychend for study. When they had conquered the world, would the destiny of the Lizardfolk be his own empire’s too?\n\nDenariatam’s assistant relayed to him that the preparations were ready. He looked at the thousands of warlords and soldiers around him – and the abjuration mages ready to shield them from the debris. The Lizardfolk’s destiny was to conquer other worlds – their fate was to be annihilated in a storm of magic and fire. A few thousand years later, those who destroyed them were themselves annihilated. Perhaps the Precursors usurped more than just the Lizardfolk’s golden scales. Maybe his own realm would too. Denariatam turned to his assistant, gave the order, then turned to look back at the spire as she sent a message over her T-Wave Transmitter.\n\nAt once, the abjuration mages cast their magics, as a shimmering ward appeared over the crowd. Soon after, a bright light flashed from the base of the Spire of Zerat, escaping the entrance to its blackened halls – over a few seconds, more flashes burst through the spire’s walls, as if it was being devoured from within. Then it could bear the force no longer, and the spire exploded from within. The warlords cheered as a massive blast of red and blue and orange turned the spire into a shower of blackened shards, thrown up into the sky and then hurled at the ground like javelins. One smashed against the ward above them, shattering into fist-sized fragments. The Emperor smiled."

 taychendi_empire_events.100.t: "Border Warlords Attack Neighbour"
 taychendi_empire_events.100.d: "In times of war, those warlords who live on the borders of our territory are at a natural advantage, often being given lands along their frontier to raid and plunder. In times of peace, however, half of their potential targets are cut off, their overlords unwilling to risk an all-out conflict. Usually, they are forced to make do – sometimes, they decide to take matters into their own hands.\n\nAcross our border with [J84_border_war_target.GetName], a coalition of border warlords have launched a series of unsanctioned but successful raids on enemy territory. While some call for a non-reply in the hopes of not provoking the other side, others say that we should indulge them, and declare war. If we were to take particularly harsh measures, we may be able to temper the destabilising nature of the insubordination – though perhaps at a cost to our Empire’s glory."

Though the Second Gophiran Empire was once riven by these familial conflicts, and eventually destroyed by one, this scion’s rebellion is too small to threaten the same fate – nonetheless, his rampaging army must be stopped."

 taychendi_empire_events.103.d: "The lives of slaves is nearly uniformly terrible – though the extent of the horror usually exists on a sliding scale. Slave-servants to wealthy merchants or warlords often get away with “simply” daily abuse and confinement. Slaves on the personal plantations and agricultural estates of the extremely wealthy are often whipped as an “incentive”. If a slave is sent to a mine, it is a near certainty they will be worked to death.\n\nNo wonder, then, that if a slave sees an opportunity to escape their conditions, they will usually take it. As the Kheionai once found out, in times where the slave population is engorged, the conditions for escape and revolt grow – it seems our current situation has led to that very outcome. Across our empire, slaves rise in revolt, the success of one uprising only encouraging others. We will have to put this down, and with brutal force."

 #The Depths of Aercel - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.200.t: "The Depths of Aercel"
 taychendi_empire_events.200.d: "Nanru Nakar – the greatest, largest and oldest city in Aelantir – was once named Aercel. The heart of Pre-Ruin Taychend, the city was Tacenie’s primary docking station, in which it gathered tribute from the Slaver-Noble vassals of the Precursor Empire and teleported them up to the flying city via the Vanetavanem. Naturally, such a massive city, which handled such a monumental amount of goods, needed a place to store them – and, like on their rural estates, the Slaver-Nobles preferred to hide such utilitarian necessities underground and out of sight. Over thousands of years, they built a vast system of underground warehouses, slave-barracks, reservoirs and sewers – alongside quite a few facilities they would rather keep out of Tacenie’s eye.\n\nAfter the Ruin, the city’s underground facilities were abandoned. The depths of Aercel became the Nakari Underground – a dangerous, winding warren of smooth-stone corridors, half-collapsed chambers and every danger imaginable. Every year, scavengers delve into the darkness – but, harassed by both dangerous wildlife and the mutated remnants of those slaves driven deep underground by Ebenanth, they have never managed to even remotely subdue the labyrinth. This expedition would be the first to truly attempt to reach the bottom of it.\n\nThere is one problem, though. Nanru Nakar has, is, and forever will be ruled by the Mudaliars, the most prestigious and wealthy family in Taychend, who claim descent from Liandarha Mudaliar herself, the Tacenie Precursor who was instrumental in driving the Slaver-Nobles from the city after the Ruin. With over a thousands members at any one time, they have their fingers in every corner of the city – a power that has not diminished with their fracturing into three branches following the battles against Erankar. The full support of the Mudaliars will likely be key to the success of the expedition."
 taychendi_empire_events.200.a: "Use Mudaliar support to aid the expedition"
 taychendi_empire_events.200.b: "Proceed without Mudaliar Support"

 taychendi_empire_events.201.t: "The Undercity"
 taychendi_empire_events.201.d: "There are a thousand entrances to the Underground in Nanru Nakar, tucked away in side-streets, basements of Pre-Ruin buildings and sewer pipes – but most of these are small or treacherous routes, which only give access to the Undercity, the inhabited upper layers of the underground where the destitute vagrants and criminal classes of the city live, away from the attention (and protection) of the city guard.\n\nIn order to march a full expedition into the unexplored depths of Aercel – the Underwarren – one needs to go through Nakar Kriadvai. The district of ruins, Kriadvai is dotted with excavated passages to the Underwarren, specially expanded over the years to support larger expeditions. It is in these entrances, in their own little slices of the Undercity, that the Scavenger Guilds have made their home. They have already supplied a great deal of knowledge and expertise to this particular Imperial expedition – but apparently, they were not quite satiated with their compensation.\n\nAs the expedition prepared to descend into the undercity, they were met by a blockade a scavengers, demanding a larger cut of the profits – though they could simply be dispersed, the implicit threat is there all the same: if the Emperor denied their request, they could make life very difficult indeed."
 taychendi_empire_events.201.a: "Use contacts within the relic-trade to get the guild to back off."
 taychendi_empire_events.201.b: "Pay off the scavenger guilds."
 taychendi_empire_events.201.c: "Let them do their worst."

 taychendi_empire_events.202.t: "Into the Dark"
 taychendi_empire_events.202.d: "Denariatam felt unease as the army halted at the edge of the Underwarren. The warm lights of the Undercity had receded, the harsh blue-white of targeted mage-light replacing them. Many Nakari citizens had gathered to watch them depart, eager to catch a glimpse of the Emperor, or say goodbye to any scavengers they knew in the army – as they had just been reminded, some were undoubtedly there with ulterior motives. To tail them, maybe pick some of them off, swindle them as the scavengers had done – the Underground was a lawless place, after all.\n\nThat didn’t bother the Emperor, though. He had ten thousand elves with him – a sizable number even on the field of battle. A number of the Mudaliars, alongside the King of Nakar Kriadvai, had joined him, alongside some other warlords who had tagged along, eager for glory. No, Denariatam’s real fear was the unknown. Steel, after all, could cut through flesh far better than it could cut through darkness.\n\nBut he’d just have to deal with it – with a short speech and a flash of his sabre, the Emperor called for the Expedition to advance further into the dark."
 taychendi_empire_events.202.a: "One way or another, they would uncover Aercel’s secrets."

 taychendi_empire_events.203.t: "A Precursor Armoury"
 taychendi_empire_events.203.d: "When the abjuration mages finally unwound the wards, and the artificers blasted through the smooth-stone doors, it was like walking into the past. The armoury was pristine, with white-washed walls, racks of Precursor weapons and shining sets of armour, interspersed with beautiful, bone-white statues of the elves of ages past.\n\nThen the statues – the Challúmata – came to life. As soon as they detected intruders, they awoke from their “slumber”, grabbed the nearest weapons to them, and charged, acting on commands issued thousands of years ago, by long dead masters. Animated through necromancy, the souls of the dead coursing through their metal bodies, their advance did not stop until they were dismembered, hacked or blasted apart – even then, their broken limbs did not give up, only stopping their unyielding crusade when the priests surged forwards and exorcised them.\n\nBy the end of the battle, the white walls of the armoury had been painted red with the blood of Taychendi who had tried to plunder it – but the defenders were nothing more lifeless husks too. Now, Denariatam needed to decide what to do with its contents."
 taychendi_empire_events.203.a: "Sell the weapons and armour to the adventurers."
 taychendi_empire_events.203.b: "Give it to the artificers so they can use them in their gadgets."

 taychendi_empire_events.204.t: "Deep Elves Attack"
 taychendi_empire_events.204.d: "The Underwarren of Nanru Nakar holds many terrors, that have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of scavengers and vagrants alike over the years – the assassin-like Dey Vettaga, swarms of sheer-toothed Kotakompu, tank-like giant armadillos, idle or wandering Challúmata, and elves hiding in the shadows, who would much prefer their works out of the public eye – Cultists of Urazhil or devious blood mages. But those threats are not what the scav guilds fear the most.\n\nThe expedition was encamped when the pale ones attacked.\n\nThey spared no prisoners, they gave no warning – one moment the lookouts were starting into the darkness, the next they were fighting for their lives. The Kriadvahna, pale-skinned elves who have dwelt in the depths of Aercel for a thousand years or more, are slight but fierce, devious warriors. Using their command over magic and their command over the Underground’s treacherous terrain, they are a formidable enemy – and seem to always have just enough numbers to make the life of an enemy hell.\n\nAs piercing screams and the rumble of mage-fire echoes through the camp, everyone must do their part, or else the Expedition may well face a very grim fate indeed."
 taychendi_empire_events.204.a: "Hold the line and fight them off!"
 taychendi_empire_events.204.b: "Fight them as best you can."

 taychendi_empire_events.205.t: "Demons in the Depths?"
 taychendi_empire_events.205.d: "It was a hard fought battle, but eventually the Kriadvahna were driven off, leaving behind scores of dead warriors, bone-pale white and Taychendi tan both. By morning, the Expedition had tallied its losses, packed up its tents and supplies, and readied to both move deeper into the underground, and face any more Kriadvahna attacks.\n\nThey were relieved, however, to not face any. As the expedition approached, any Kriadvahna scouts they were lucky enough to spot quickly fled – as they came across Kriadvahna villages and encampments, they found them deserted in a hurry. The deep elves did not even bother to take their belongings, which the expeditionaries happily helped themselves to.\n\nThe scholars and mages were astonished to find the Kriadvahna – long thought to be merely mindless savages – actually had a strong material culture, shaped from the various items found in the Underground. Among their works of art were those of a more religious significance – most dedicated to defending against demons from above, but some against unknown terrors from below too.\n\nIn one such village, soldiers came across an area marked with signs of danger and caution, obvious even to outsiders – delving deeper, they discovered a strange altar, guarded by broken, exorcised Challúmata. There were intact scrolls atop it – and some are saying that the Emperor may be able to commune with whatever the altar was dedicated to."
 taychendi_empire_events.205.a: "Commune with it."
 taychendi_empire_events.205.b: "Burn the scrolls, destroy the altar, and loot everything nearby of value."

 taychendi_empire_events.206.t: "Last Dying Breath"
 taychendi_empire_events.206.d: "The Expedition had thought the Kriadvahna had been cowed, afraid of the might of the demons above. They advanced lazily deeper into the darkness, swatting away or shooting anything that came near.\n\nWhen the first calls of “Kriadvahna!” rang out, many thought it was just a raid, maybe an overeager lookout pointing out a shout – then the screams and desperate shouts, and the musket fire and mage-bolts and clash of steel and rending of flesh. Before even ten minutes had passed, the Exepditionaries understood what they were facing – why they had faced so few of the denizens of the Underground. They were not retreating, but regrouping.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of pale elven warriors attacked at once. Most either bore simple spears, slings, axes, or used their hands as spell focuses – their champions bore glistening Precursor armour and blades of enchanted ruin-steel. Each Kriadvahna fought tirelessly, desperately, as if their whole people was at stake, as if their world would end if they lost. They fought with wounds that would send most others crying for their mothers or for intercession – climbed over the bodies of their fallen kin to keep up the assault. They had a single battle cry on their lips – “lai-dan-har!”\n\nIf the expedition does not fight with the same determination as their enemy, things are going to get very bloody indeed."
 taychendi_empire_events.206.a: "Hold the line and fight them off!"
 taychendi_empire_events.206.b: "Fight them as best you can."

 taychendi_empire_events.207.t: "The Glow"
 taychendi_empire_events.207.d: "After a few hours, the fighting died down, and the Kriadvahna retreated. The expedition, bruised, bloodied, but alive, continued into the depths in a grim sort of silence. The Kriadvahna would not be coming back, not for anything – they wouldn’t risk extinction by attacking again. All that was left now was for the expeditionaries to discover what the Kriadvahna had so jealously guarded.\n\nThey found out soon enough. As they descended, the warning signs that had been found near that altar repeated – and grew more dire. The mages of the expedition complained of headaches – and of unnatural power, mana coursing through the air. A blue mist formed as the party advanced – then, they saw the writing. Most could not read it – but the scholars identified it well enough. “STAY OUT!” “DO NOT ADVANCE!” “DOOM AHEAD!” “BEWARE THE GLOW!” All written in an ancient tongue – not that of the ancient Kalavendhi, nor the Slaver Nobles, but of Tacenie.\n\nThe warnings came to an ancient chamber, large enough to house an ancient dragon. The expeditionaries gasped as they entered – hundreds of thousands – maybe millions – of golden Precursor slave collars had been piled high in the vault, like how a dragon hoarded gold. Every single collar had a damestear crystal within, bathing the room in a near-blinding blue light. There were four Kriadvahna champions in the room, wearing the silver-steel armour of the ancients, praying, kneeling. They turned, gorged on the might of magic, and charged.\n\nOnly after they had felled scores of Taychendi soldiers were they dispatched – the Emperor himself, the Mudaliar-King of Nakar Kriadvai by his side, approached what they had once guarded. A single skeleton, clad in resplendent armour, laid against the foot of the pile of collars. A message had been written at her feet.\n\n“MY NAME IS LIANDIEL. MY CHILDREN CALL ME LIANDARHA. REMEMBER ME.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.207.a: "“By the gods…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.208.t: "The Tomb of Liandarha"
 taychendi_empire_events.208.d: "“Mother of my blood!” the Mudaliar-King cried, as he fell to his knees. “Mother of my blood, we have found you again!”\n\nThe purpose of the chamber was clear – this was the tomb of Liandarha Mudaliar, the once-mythical founder of the Mudaliar Dynasty, who descended from Tacenie to smite the Slaver-Nobles who had once ruled the city. In a way, it was also the tomb of the Slaver-Nobles themselves. The implements of their eponymous rule, their gilded slave-collars, as elegant and beautiful in form as they were brutal and domineering in their conception, had been stockpiled, hidden away. A fortune of gold and damestear.\n\nOn closer inspection, most of the collars were deformed, battered or broken. Many of their pure damestear crystals had been cracked, shattered. Having surely once glowed a bright white, even a thousand years later they still glowed a warm blue. And having been radiating their magic away for thousands of years, exposed to the air? The glow was poison.\n\nTo say that the expedition is divided on what to do with the tomb would probably be an overstatement – most are united on their desire to haul the collars to the surface, and scrap them for all they’re worth (though some mages would prefer they are given some for study.) There are some, however, who wish to honour what they believe is Liandarha’s wish, and seal the tomb. No matter our choice, though it seems there are some side passages that suggest Nanru Nakar goes deeper, it is unlikely we will be able to continue on."
 taychendi_empire_events.208.a: "Seal the tomb and let Liandarha rest"
 taychendi_empire_events.208.m: "Seal the collars, and bring Liandarha’s body up for burial."
 taychendi_empire_events.208.b: "Loot the tomb and scrap the collars for gold and damestear"
 taychendi_empire_events.208.c: "Loot the tomb, and give a portion of the collars to the mages for study"

 taychendi_empire_events.209.t: "Slave Collars Sold Off"
 taychendi_empire_events.209.d: "Since we looted the tomb of Liandarha, we have been gradually been selling off the gold and damestear salvaged from the ruined slave collars, selling them to buyers across Taychend. After years of profit, we have finally made our final sales.\n\nNakar Kriadvai, which had thrived from the salvaging operations for years, can now return to its previous trade of scavenging Precursor relics from the Nakari Underground."
 taychendi_empire_events.209.a: "Great News!"

 #The Woman in the Shadows - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.300.t: "The Woman in the Shadows"
 taychendi_empire_events.300.d: "Denariatam paced restlessly around the palace gardens, fists balled behind his back, gritted teeth pointed at the floor. It had not been a good week for him – virtually everything he had been working on had seen one failure or another. Even when he lay in bed he struggled to think of anything other than the slights and the setbacks – and so he was out here, at an ungodly time of the night.\n\n“Trouble sleeping?” A woman’s voice roused the Emperor from his musings. He turned, startled – then, as he noticed a humanoid figure in the shadow of the garden, reached for the dagger at his hip. The woman in the shadows raised her hands in a show of peace. \n\n“What do you want?” The Emperor asked, as the woman emerged into torchlight. Denariatam could see her pale skin, her dark red hair – a Cannorian. “Who let you in!?”\n\n“Who let me in? Well, your guards, for one. Hmmm… your servants too. Your slaves… you get the idea.” The woman smiled mischievously. “It really wasn’t difficult, especially for someone like me.”\n“Like you…?”\nThe woman waved the question away. “Unimportant. I really came here for a… minor request.” She emerged from the shadows completely, now. Denariatam could see that her skin was like a bone-white. Despite himself, the Emperor felt strangely at ease – like he was being lulled to inaction. “I’ve been looking to start a family – not with you! – and I need a place to call home. Your Empire sounded like such a… perfect place.”\n\nThe woman stepped closer – took the Emperor’s hand in hers, smiled as she looked into his eyes. Somehow, despite it all, he found himself ignoring the sharp, pointed fangs at the corners of her mouth. “All you have to do is say yes… and I’ll try to keep in touch. What do you say?”"
 taychendi_empire_events.300.a: "“Sure…?”"
 taychendi_empire_events.300.b: "“I don’t think so.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.301.t: "The Errant Princess"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.d: "The Emperor stared at the human woman sitting on the other side of the desk, her legs crossed, hands in her lap, a disarming smile on her lips, as if nothing had happened. He wasn’t as naive now as he had been 10 years ago, though. Since their last meeting, since the nameless woman had taken up residence north-west of Nanru Nakar, there had been disturbing reports. People disappearing, shadows hunting in the night, bodies found drained of blood – with fang marked necks.\n\n“You know why you are here, don’t you?” The Emperor asked. He felt that same blanket of ease fall over him – though he tried to throw it off.\n“I believe I do.” The woman replied, calm as anything.\n“Then what do you have to say for yourself? In your defence?”\n\nThe woman chuckled. “In my defence? Nothing. The rumours are true. It’s all me.” The Emperor placed a hand on the sabre at his hip – how could one look so amused when admitting to murder? “I’m what’s called a “vampire.” Have to feed, I’m afraid, or I’ll go all crazy. We wouldn’t want that, would we?”\n\nThe Emperor grimaced. “Are you going to give me a reason not to have you killed?”\n\nShe laughed again – a belly laugh this time. “Oh, I’d love to see you try!” Denariatam stayed his hand – and tried to control his pounding heartbeat, and the chill in his spine. “But I think I have a better idea! My name is Mihaela – I’m what you could call an Errant Prince. As in: I’m one of the most powerful of my kind “alive”. I grew… tired of the petty tyrants and traitors of my homeland. And now I’m here… and I think we could come to a very, very useful partnership indeed. If you reject me, I’ll vanish – you’ll never see me again. But allow me to build up my power, here in Taychend? I will give you more power than you’ve ever imagined.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.a: "“That does sound enticing…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.b: "“Absolutely not, to Cerachmanu with you!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.302.t: "Meeting under the Moon"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.d: "“You wanted to see me?” The Emperor asked. Mihaela stood on the balcony, staring out at the city beyond – she gestured to a full wine cup nearby, and Denariatam soon joined her at the railing.\n“Your land is so… beautiful.” Mihaela said, distant. “So many people clawing for glory, blood. Controlled chaos. A hunting ground for people like me… and maybe, for people like us.”\n\nThat “us” sent a shiver down Denariatam’s back. Mihaela turned to face him. She was beautiful, captivating… but it was never a “normal” beauty. The Emperor doubted it was how she actually looked, for one – but there was also always something tainting her, always some emotion saturating the way she looked. Wrath, envy, malevolence… today, she was dripping with so much pride – so much vainglory – that Denariatam reflexively stepped back, a hand on his sabre. For the first time, he did not see a partner – but a pretender.\n\n“When I first came to Taychend, I just wanted to live my life how I wanted, in total freedom. The chaos was so alluring – no Blood Court, no subordinates scheming to rule the shadows. But now I look out and realise what my children once did, what I tried to so hard to reject… so long as you’re on top, control and chaos aren’t so exclusive. I think you’ve realised that too.”\n\nMihaela stepped forwards, raised a hand to the Emperor’s cheek. He froze at her touch. “I want to make you an offer – my final one. Put me on top. Allow me to ascend to where I’ve always been destined to be… and I will give you the freedom I’ve enjoyed for so long. The freedom of the hunt… the freedom of immortality… the freedom of Vampirism. And then? We will rule the chaos, side by side – and we shall rule it forever.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.a: "Accept her offer"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.b: "Reject her offer"

 taychendi_empire_events.303.t: "The Pale Queen Rises"
 taychendi_empire_events.303.d: "Moonlight illuminated the Vanetavanem’s thrown room as Mihaela sank into her throne. Jaher, Jexis, Munas, Garion? Those pretentious, upjumped elves had thought to lord over Cannor – and now she’d stolen half their home continent out from under them! There had been growing pains. Not everyone had accepted the sudden change in ruler. But Mihaela had made up some fiction about how she’d discovered the “Bloody Hand of Kadradar” – an idea shamelessly stolen from that fool Silverspite. A fiction that cast herself as a Relic-Lord instead of some monstrous abomination. They accepted it well enough – and now she was “Veliara, the Pale Queen.”\n\nShe looked out at the assembled crowd before her – and grinned as she imagined the millions outside. She’d been reading up on the great houses of Taychend, and was delighted to find every one of them in the audience. She spotted an old friend in the crowd too – someone she had once called a friend. She gave Theodore sína Trinás, her fellow Errant Prince, a nod. The Blood Court would come for her, try to stop her – but she wasn’t going to be beaten this time.\n\nThe former Emperor advanced towards her, crown in hand – too slowly for Mihaela’s taste. She stood, walked over, grabbed the crown from his hands and then placed it on her head. The crowd was confused for a moment, as their new ruler walked back to her throne, then twirled on her heel to face them again. Mihaela drew her rapier, pointing it to the sky.\n\n“Subjects!” She called, pride surging as the words left her mouth. “For too long, you’ve been content with “normal” men ruling over you – well, no longer! This day marks the dawn of a new Taychend – one where my power is absolute! And in return? Do you want glory?” The crowd looked confused – some, though, nodded. “Do you want conquest?!” Now there were calls, cheers of agreement. “Do you want riches?!” The response grew louder, fuller, as the crowd grew more riled, excited. “Do you want blood?!” And tens of thousands cried “Blood!” in response. “Do you want to rule the world?!” And the entire crowd cried “the world! The world! The world!”"
 taychendi_empire_events.303.a: "“So bow to me, and I will give you everything you’ve ever dreamed!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.304.t: "A Game of Shadows"
 taychendi_empire_events.304.d: "Theodore put a hand to his temple as he poured another glass of wine. “Everything that could have went wrong has,” he complained, as he took the glass and took a swig. “Its like we’re not even making a dent!” The Errant Prince had been in charge of the shadow war against Mihaela for 20 years. He’d tried every trick in the book, spent enough money on the project to bankrupt the Gnomish Hierarchy twice over, but Mihaela’s forces had thrown every plot and scheme back. \n\nThe other Errant Prince in the room, sitting on the other side of the table, sighed. “It has to be expected.” Renaud began, as he took a sip from his own glass. “She has the resources of half of Aelantir at her disposal, not to mention her new clan. I have to say… Mihaela has not broken the Masquerade. Everything I’ve seen has told me that she hasn’t told a soul that other Errant Princes even exist! Let alone… well, I’ve heard no mention of our sire anywhere. Maybe we should just… give up?”\n\nTheodore shook his head, scowling – angry at both his friend’s suggestion and how much he agreed with it. “The Blood Court is not happy, Renaud… Mihaela is a loose canon – you know that, I know that– and…” Now it was Theodore’s turn to sigh. “...they’re starting to not be happy with you either.”\nRenaud laughed. “Oh, and why would that be?”\n“You know why.” Theodore took another swig of wine. “They don’t like that you’re the only one of us turning a profit on this. You’ve been invaluable, but–”\n\n“–But they’re getting nervous about my loyalties? Then I may as well give them another show.” Renaud took out his notebook. “How about Orenkoraim again? There are some Sarhali mercenaries I think I can have sent over...” Theodore nodded through the plan, though he already knew how it would turn out. The Errant Prince downed his glass, and reached for the bottle again."
 taychendi_empire_events.304.a: "“Once more unto the breach…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.305.t: "Blood Ties"
 taychendi_empire_events.305.d: "Mihaela threw the body to the floor, wiped the blood of her mouth. Another revolt, another round of vampire hunters and upstart adventurers. Port cities across the Taychendi coast had been thrown into chaos – but they’d meet their fate just like the rest. The Pale Queen turned to her underling – the former Emperor was wiping blood off his sword. “Another night, another badn of hunters, another failure. I think dear Theodore is finally running out of tricks!” Denariatam simply nodded the comment away, then returned to caring for his sabre – Mihaela called his name again, invoked her right, and his gaze snapped up. “If something is wrong, spit it out.”\n\n“I was thinking,” Denariatam replied, a little too curtly for Mihaela’s taste, “about the Slaver-Nobles. You’ve read of them, yes?”\nMihaela laughed. “I might be foreign, but I’m not ignorant.”\n“Right, of course. Well, their immortality allowed them to dominate the world, keep it in order for thousands of years… I was just thinking that our kind – us, as vampires – do we not have that same power? The Cycle of Glory is one of chaos… mortal elves clamouring for ascension, apotheosis. But we’ve forgone that… so we stand above. The next cycle would be–”\n\nMihaela held up a finger – Denariatam halted immediately. “A Cycle of Blood, right? Order through blood. We will be the new Slaver-Nobles, ruling over the masses, with total liberty, the ability to do whatever we want…” A wicked grin formed on the Errant Princess’ face as she spoke – as pictures of an immortal empire formed in her mind. “And with the world under my total control… I will finally prove the others wrong– do what my children failed to do, what Theodore and the others don’t want me to do! Live as I was meant to!”\n\n“The Blood Court…” Mihaela raised an eyebrow – Denariatam was not supposed to mention them, but she let it slide, just this once. “Will they truly let you? There is one of you, and–”\n\nThe Pale Queen laughed away her underling’s concerns. “Please… the only thing the others care about is saving their arses… and once I send Theodore back to them in his coffin, they’ll understand the right way to do that. Renaud is turning… next time, he’ll face me himself.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.305.a: "“And we’ll see what power really is.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.306.t: "A Duel at Midnight"
 taychendi_empire_events.306.d: "Mihaela was in her trophy room in Nanru Nakar when Theodore sína Trinas arrived. She saw him enter through a display of Kaydhano glass – when Mihaela stepped out, Theodore spotted her immediately – his eyes narrowed. “Oh, Theodore…” Mihaela smiled, as she walked between the displays. “It’s been so long! Have you enjoyed your little trips to Taychend…?”\n“I have not.” Theodore replied. After all these years, he still looked the typical Roilsardi gentleman, a rapier hung at his side. The two vampires began to circle each other. “You rule over a stolen empire, in a stolen palace, filled with stolen relics. Just seeing all this makes me sick.”\n\nMihaela laughed. “Oh, does it now? You know what makes me sick? When I think of how the Blood Court tried to bind me, stop me from living how we were meant to live! It makes me sick when I think about how you murdered my child!”\nTheodore’s anger flashed. “Your child murdered himself! You tried to restrain him, remember? Gods, Mihaela–you’re just a bundle of regret, and guilt, and spite, aren’t you?! A little girl lashing out!”\n\n“That’s what you think…?” Within, the Pale Queen raged too – but she contained it, then channelled it. “No… you just don’t understand. I’ve moved past your petty conflicts… your petty fear. Only I can see what is true glory! After this is done? After you all understand just what you’re dealing with…? My armies will march, and my ships will sail, and the very blood of the world shall fuel my conquests! And then, at the end of it all, I will stand atop Halann, and smile… master of the new cycle! The Empress of Halann!”\n\nTheodore stared at his former comrade, astonished, mouth agape.“What happened to you?” He whispered. Then he shook his head – shook the doubt away. “No, no… I get it. I understand. You’ve gone mad… and this will be a mercy.” Theodore, drew his rapier, and took a decisive step forwards – glass displays shattered as his boot struck the floor.\nMihaela laughed. “My my–you’re actually approaching me?”\nThe Errant Prince pulled an silver-thorned stake from his cloak. “I can’t torpor you without getting any closer!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.307.d: "The battle between Theodore and Mihaela lasted seven hours. Each took and dealt enough punishment to kill a dragon, as the battle between them destroyed swathes of Nanru Nakar. But Mihaela knew the terrain. Knew the rivers, knew the bridges, knew which properties she owned and which she didn’t. It was only a matter of time – then a failed ambush, a rapier a second away from severing the brain in two, a perfect counter and a desperate struggle, and Mihaela held a stake over Theodore’s heart.\n\nThe Vampire-Empress cackled as she pinned Theodore to the ground, her hair dishevelled, eyes psychotic in victory. “THERE–! I got you– I beat you! I WON!”\nTheodore gritted his teeth. “Always the same with you, isn’t it–?! Nothing but gloating, arrogance–! What a sick joke!”\n“A joke?!” Mihaela lashed out, struck Theodore across the face. “You don’t know anything! None of you do! None of you know what its like! Everyone failed me– everyone!”\n“You failed yourself! Time and time again– and now what, millions have to die because of that?! This is Gerbuta all over again! The farmhouse!”\n“That– that wasn’t my fault! They should’ve– I didn’t– I– FUCK YOU–!” Mihaela struck him again, and again, and again. The world shook with every strike – but Theodore didn’t scurry away this time.\n“Our kind… we’re a mistake already, Mihaela… don’t add to it. Please…”\n\nMihaela raised the stake high. Theodore raised his hands reflexively – but she never delivered the coup de grace. “Is that what you really think?”\n“You know it is…”\nShe did. Mihaela grimaced as old memories flashed. Burnt castles, burnt bodies, burnt bridges. “Its too late for that…” Mihaela admitted. “Far too late. You think we’re mistakes…? Fine. But I won’t be a failure.” The Errant Princess threw the stake away and stood, turned to walk away – Theodore got up after her.\n\n“What do you want me to tell the Court?” Theodore asked, as he raised a hand to his battered face. “They may come after you again…”\n“Tell them I’ll leave them alone… and I won’t reveal their secrets. And…” Mihaela turned to Theodore again, and smiled. “Tell them that when I conquer the world, I’ll give them all the order they want.”"

 #The Echoes of Ebenanth - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.400.t: "The Echoes of Ebenanth"
 taychendi_empire_events.400.d: "The Emperor sank into his padded chair with a sigh. He knew temple dedications were necessary to show piety to the gods, but they were just so long and tedious – made worse when the Cult of Ebenanth insisted on him reciting the prayers himself. Denariatam just wanted to rest, sign off some unimportant paperwork, and finish his day with a glass of wine and a relaxing bath.\n\nThe Blue House, however, had other ideas. One moment he was happily procrastinating, the next the room was lit up by the light of magic, as a robed figure teleported into the room. The mage thankfully held up the sign of the Nila Tenvach – the foremost magical institution in Taychend – before Denariatam could call for his guards.\n\n“I come bearing words from the Pinnacle, Emperor,” the mage explained. “The construction of this temple to Ebenanth in Pattivaram has proven to the Archmages that you have… an appreciation of the liege of our founder.”\nDenariatam chuckled. “Right, your founder Sulathrezhil… a key member of the conspiracy that murdered Ebenanth?” The Blue House worshipped both – it naturally led to some contradictions. “Well I do appreciate him, as all good rulers do – but I’m not sure what your point is?”\n\n“Have you ever imagined yourself wielding Starshear? The power to call down the energies of the Astral sky at your command? Annihilate entire cities? We believe that with your resources and our knowledge, that dream may come to pass.” The mage took a box out from his robe, placing it on the Emperor’s desk.\n\n“When Ebenanth met his end, the jewel that powered Starshear was shattered, divided into five shards – in a last ditch effort to save his life, Ebenanth attempted to “imprint” his soul onto his relic. He only left a whisper, an echo–” The mage opened the box, revealing a crystal shard that glowed a brilliant white. “–but an echo is enough. Ebenanth’s memories bind the shards enchantments together…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.401.desc: "After the death of Ebenanth, the relic on which he based his power, Starshear, was fractured by his mutinous generals, who shared the Shards of Starshear among themselves. Though the “Council of Warlords” tried to rule Ebenanth’s Empire, they quickly fell, and the Shards first passed to the warlords’ successors, then to opportunistic scavengers, then to legend. But with our resources, we have the resources to make legends reality – we just need to decide how to make that happen.\n\nThe first option would simply be to hire masses of adventurers and have them comb Taychend – tried, true, but expensive.\n\nThe second option is to use powerful divination magic, by giving our court mage as many resources as they could need, employing our mages in scrying or improving their latent divination abilities, or perhaps relying on our capital’s traditions.\n\nThe third option would be to use an extensive spy network, by improving the nation’s external or internal intelligence capabilities, employing expert spymasters and giving them as many resources as they could possibly want, or perhaps relying on our capital’s ancient contacts.\n\nOf course, should the Emperor have a powerful being backing them, or be a powerful enough mage as to effect the whole realm, and have legendary skill in that magic, then they may be able to uncover the shards by their own power."

 taychendi_empire_events.402.d: "Despite extensive investment, our recent efforts have failed to find any leads on the Shards of Starshear. We will need to redouble our efforts – and potentially change tactics – in order to retrieve the Great-Relic’s fragments."
 taychendi_empire_events.402.a: "Restart the search."

 taychendi_empire_events.403.t: "Accession"
 taychendi_empire_events.403.d: "The first Shard had been held by the Blue House for centuries, seized from the plains of Parahechend. When the Emperor first touched the shard, it was if his head was plunged into water, then pulled into the air another elf breathed, a thousand years ago.\n– – –\nEbenanth felt the jolt of every gallop as he rode through the ashen waste. Clouds of grey dust swirled in the air, half a storm. Even now, forty years after the Ruin, it was as if someone had drained the colour from the world. Starved trees rose from the arid fields, spine-like. Eventually, he arrived at a “city”, circled with mud-brick walls plated with scrap. Its inhabitants – dressed in rags and leathers, emaciated, near-soulless – looked up to the Slaver-Noble and his mount in awe. Most horses had been eaten for meat in the years after the Ruin – people had simply forgotten how to ride. But Ebenanth made remembering the old ways a point of pride – and spite.\n\nWhen Ebenanth finally dismounted before the fortified hall that served as Pattivaram’s capitol, and entered his father’s chambers, his hands balled into fists. Ultrathikeyan Starshear laid on his death bed, withered and aged. He had shrunken into himself now, his muscles atrophied, dark-blue hair turned wisp-white. The sight – the knowledge that he had never been able to see his father in his ten-thousand year prime – made Ebenanth simmer with rage. He had been born twenty years after the Ruin, and eight years after the Slaver-Nobles had been driven from Aercel – their glory was now only a memory.\n\nEbenanth kneeled beside his father, head bowed in reverence, and to hide his anger. He was woken from his vigil by a tap on his shoulder – he startled at both the staff that had touched him, and his father’s gaze. The last wisps of once-immortal fire burned in Ulrathikeyan’s eyes, as he passed his staff to his son, looked south, and spoke his last words."
 taychendi_empire_events.403.a: "“Our city… our rule… our power… take it back!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.404.t: "Reclamation"
 taychendi_empire_events.404.d: "The second Shard was found buried in Ameion. Taken by the Ambhen government for safekeeping, it was lost during its sacking by Taychendi forces.\n– – – \nEbenanth rode through the city in triumph, Starshear on his back, as his lieutenant’s chariots rattled behind him. The bloody remnants of the rebels’ resistance were strewn about the avenues. He had only seen Aercel from a distance before now, the monolith of their past power. The buildings had not yet fallen to ruin – but forty years of neglect had made their mark nonetheless. The entire city was ash-stained, desolate.\n\nAt last, the Relic-Lord came to the piercing tower at the city’s heart. His father had told him of how they could send a ship’s load of goods up to the sky in an instant, with a snap of their fingers. “Tribute for their so-called-masters in Tacenie”. The words dripped with a venom Ebenanth rarely heard. His father did not talk much of the days before the Ruin – but he knew something had caused it, and that it was not the Slaver-Nobles’ fault. That was enough for him to put things together.\n\nEbenanth grimaced, even as he beheld the great chamber at the statue’s base. He had incinerated half of Liandiel’s army – but his victory was half-done. She had fled to the underground. With Aercel’s depths in such disrepair, it was unlikely they would be found – but unlikely they would pose much threat either. The more pressing issue was the rest of the scions of Tacenie – they had fled to the south, to that steel-fortress on the lower Kalavend, and the safety of its invader-loving, traitorous ruler.\n\nHe would have to ride against them too, and soon. After 38 years of exile, Aercel had finally been returned to its rightful owner – now, it was time to show everyone that the Slaver-Nobles were back…"
 taychendi_empire_events.404.a: "…and by Starshear’s power, they would reclaim all they had lost."

 taychendi_empire_events.405.t: "Annihilation"
 taychendi_empire_events.405.d: "The third Shard was found in the Larankarha highlands, lost when a warlord tried to conquer the Advakhalla.\n– – – \nEbenanth strode out into the arid fields below the waste, Sulathrezhil and Darandal behind him, and the Steel-Citadel before him. It was titanic, a testament to its ruler’s wealth and power. An ashen storm swirled above, strangling the sun, but the silver-steel plates that adorned its walls still managed to glisten.\n\n“Ah, the son of Ulrathikeyan!” A voice called from the Citadel’s battlements – even a wraith-like husk, the Slaver-Noble warlord still kept his commanding voice. “Come to add us to your new empire?”\nEbenanth studied the soldiers manning the walls – a hundred different colours adorning their heads. “No… I don’t think so! You’re a traitor Aldatarel! You consorted with the scions of Tacenie! The ones who doomed us all, stole our might!”\n“Doomed!?” The ancient elf raised his hands, alongside every battlemage on the walls. “This is no less their work than ours! But that won’t matter soon enough. The past is dying, Ebenanth! In a hundred years, Ducaniel’s name will be forgotten– and your legacy will be naught but ruin!”\n\nEbenanth simply scoffed, and raised his staff to the ashen skies. As mage-fire alighted the walls, Starshear’s prismatic jewel glowed a brilliant white, exploded into light, then went dark. Sulathrezhil surged forwards, cast a powerful ward around them – and then the power of the Astral cut through the dark of day.\n\nWhen the bolt of light struck the Citadel, it ran it through clean. The steel rippled, the walls buckled, then light burst through every window, every opening – and then heat, and smoke, and starfire. The top of the fortress erupted, blasted open – and then the Steel-Citadel collapsed in on its self, the very metal screaming in pain. As Sulathrezil’s ward held, and the ash of his enemy’s destruction subsided, Ebenanth smiled."
 taychendi_empire_events.405.a: "“And the past was buried in his wake.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.406.t: "Revelation"
 taychendi_empire_events.406.d: "The fourth Shard was found in the possession of a merchant in Oremvand. He did not have the arcane capacity to understand its true nature – to him, it was just another jewel.\n– – – \nDarandal struck the green-haired elf, sending him and the chair he was tied to tumbling to the floor. Blood sprayed across the smooth-stone walls. Ebenanth sighed as Darandal pulled the Imperial upright – evidentially, they’d been interrogating him for days. “Talk, Imperial, and it stops.” The child of Tacenie – a second generation elf, twice Ebenanth’s age – looked up to the First Emperor. “We’ve traced as many Imperials as we can. I know where Liandiel is, I know where Vaceran and the rats in the north are. So tell me – where did you come from?”\n\nThe prisoner sputtered out a denial. “My mother never told me– Never! I’ve told you fifteen times… just believe me… please!”\nEbenanth’s eyes narrowed. “You don’t want us to take another hand, do you?”\nDarandal unsheathed the sword on his back – the prisoner eyed the blade for a moment, then broke at last. “My… my family came from the west– the steppe. I was born on Tacenie… we were among the last to leave.”\n\nEbenanth’s eyes went wide. Every Imperial they’d found, hunted, had told them the exact same thing – Tacenie had been destroyed, its location unknown, remnants scattered. He’d thought it’d crashed in the northern mountains– but he’d been looking in the wrong place the entire time. “Where!? Where in the steppe!? Tell me!”\n\nThe prisoner closed his eyes, sighed. “I don’t know… when most folk left, the rest put a glamour over it – for protection... its just another part of the horizon, now.” Ebenanth smiled, even as he felt his heart pound. If his family lived in Tacenie for even a year, that meant it was not only in the east… but intact. The last of the flying cities. Ebenanth turned to Darandal."
 taychendi_empire_events.406.a: "“Kill him, then follow me – we have an expedition to plan.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.407.t: "Ascension"
 taychendi_empire_events.407.d: "The fifth Shard was found in the ownership of a Cannorian adventurer, who had brought it to Anbenncost – it took an intricate heist by thieves of the Na’Sharan to recover it.\n– – – \nEbenanth sulked as he walked through camp, his general Keshelanar following close behind. The Western Expedition – the great incursion into the western steppes – had been a total failure. Even the public objectives hadn’t been fulfilled. While the overland route to the prisons of the western peninsular had been cut off in the Ruin, the descendents of the great slave revolt not only eluded his forces, but withered them. He had taken captives, massacred villages, but it could not recoup his losses..\n\nAnd Tacenie… only he, Darandal, and a few others knew of that hidden goal. He had thought he might be able to find it through trial and error, or at least divination – but he was wrong. It wasn’t politically disadvantageous, but that failure cut Ebenanth deepest of all. Now all he could do was sound the retreat.\n\nAs Ebenanth entered the command tent, he was surprised to find his generals assembled – and the meeting table missing. They had clearly smelt weakness, and pounced – but he understood that too late. The First Emperor pulled his staff from his back, but Sulathrezhil caught his hand with telekinesis – when Ebenanth raised his left to cast a spell, Keshelanar surged forwards and cut it off.\n\nEbenanth fell to the floor, gritting his teeth in pain as he clutched his stump. Starshear clattered to the ground ahead of him. Darandal righted him with his boot, then ran his sword through his back. As his blood pooled around him, everything he’d accomplished – the conquest, the destruction, the glory, the death, the ruin – flashed before his eyes. He had got so close… the rule of the Slaver-Nobles so nearly restored. But it would all be for nothing. With his last embers of strength, Ebenanth reached out to the weapon that had won him his empire…"
 taychendi_empire_events.407.a: "… and in death, became first of the gods of glory."

 taychendi_empire_events.408.t: "Reunion"
 taychendi_empire_events.408.d: "The Blue-House mage went down on one knee, and presented Starshear to the Emperor – a black-wood staff, lined with ivory and ebony, and crowned with a crystal that shone a brilliant white, wreathed in a prismatic halo. Not the base wild magic of prismatic damestear – but a connection to the primordial chaos of the Astral sky.\n\n“Starshear requires a large amount of mana to use – you’ll only get about one cast per day.” Denariatam took up the staff, and just by touch felt the power coursing through. “But, well, I’ve always believed that in magic, power is superior to speed.” The archmage looked to their right – at the enemy city in the distance. “Perhaps it is time for a demonstration?”\n\nThe Emperor turned to the city in the distance. As a crowd of warlords, soldiers, mages and notables looked on, Denariatam raised Starshear to the sky, closed his eyes, and called down oblivion. He felt his magic surge, his energy pour into the staff as the crystal at its peak flared with light. For a moment, Denariatam thought he was not powerful enough, as the muscles in his body burned, as a line of blood dripped from his nose. Then, all at once, the crystal went dull – and the Emperor’s pain with it.\n\nAlmost two millennium ago, Ebenanth had sought to deny the inevitable. Turn the world back to the time of the Slaver-Nobles. But through the power of Starshear, he had only swept away the last remnants of the old world – through his death, and the destruction of all he worked towards, the last cycle breathed its last.\n\nThat power – the light of annihilation – now cut through the sky, now struck Halann with rippling force, tore apart the city before the crowd. The home of tens of thousands erupted into an explosion of light and heat and starfire, all within incinerated in an instant. Fractured, Starshear had heralded the beginning of the Cycle of Glory…"

 #The Last City - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.500.t: "The Last City"
 taychendi_empire_events.500.d: "It took hundreds of thousands of elves to search for the Last City. Each party, ten thousand strong, arms linked into a human chain five miles long, had their segments, squares of the steppe meticulously marked out over months – you probably could have seen the effort from the Astral Sky itself. Soldiers stood side by side as they marched, combed over their assigned area. Then, when they reached the other side, they would rest for the night, mark that segment as completed, then hop over into the next square and repeat, over and over again.\n\nIt took five months to stumble on the Last City. Grazing animals were pushed out of the way, villages passed through – but most inhabited parts of the steppe were ignored. It wasn’t like Tacenie would be found in the same space as a village. And so, bit by bit, quadrant by quadrant, a Taychendi boot trod each inch of the Chendhya. When a party first stumbled on their target – first stepped through the glamour that had masked the flying city’s presence for a millennium, they found the city untouched – near pristine. It was as if its inhabitants had never left.\n\nWhen the Last City had been found, it took but 24 hours until every major warlord of the realm was closing in on its location – until the Emperor themselves arrived, and finally ordered the glamour dispelled. For the first time since the Ruin, the glory of Tacenie, the last of the flying cities, was exposed to the air.\n\nNow, all they needed to do was raise it to the sky – then make it fall."

 taychendi_empire_events.501.d: "Swing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of silver steel in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize as he cut it down, like clockwork. He did not even pause to move a stray bang of green hair out of his face. It was hard work, boring work, tiring work – but it was work he was good at. He’d been practising it for millenia, after all – he’d like to think he would be.\n\nToday, the sun was beating down on them. The air was hot and dry – though the sweat made the gilded collar at the slave’s neck a little less uncomfortable, it was small consolation. Only the overseer’s whistle could give that. When it blew, the slave stood, stowed his scythe, and helped the others bring the corn stalks back to the carts.\n\nThe slaves kept their break in the shadow of their master’s statue. It towered over the field – gave them a little shade at certain points of the day, like a sun-dial. A constant yet temporary respite, given at the same time each day for the past 3491 years of the slave’s life, just like the break he received half way through the day.\n\nHe looked up to the statue, for a moment – to the elf who owned him – then to the base, built of different stone. A statue of a different, draconic master had once stood where he did – a reminder that the cycle-clock of the world had once been broken. But the dragons were but a memory, now, fallen and faded.\n\nSwing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of silver steel in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize as he cut it down, like clockwork. This time, though, something did give him pause – an extraordinary shadow. The slave looked up to see a mountain gliding across the sky – Tacenie, in all its glory. He wondered, for a moment, if the Slaver-Nobles would fall as their predecessors once did."

 taychendi_empire_events.502.da: "A hundred thousand people watched on the fields of Traerraden. Over the past few years, every inch of Tacenie had been investigated, probed, stuffed with every artificer gadget and magical implement the brightest minds of Taychend could think of. Now, those gathered, Vustarin artificer or Blue House mage, gnomish tinkerer or Ruinborn scholar, Dawn Elven techno-thaumaturgist or Cennayakuta warlock, all waited with baited breath.\n\nA hundred thousand people waited in the port of Orenkoraim, the Gathyanavaida behind them. Warlords, warriors, and of course the Emperor himself. Great projections had been set up, so that they could watch the launch in real time. Denariatam took a deep breath – glanced at those beside him, the creme of Taychendi society – then gave the signal to an aide beside him.\n\nThe soil of the steppe shook – then a wave of heat, and magic, and smoke and wind. Then, for the first time since the Ruin, since the days of Arethon and Ducaniel, Tacenie rose once more.\n\nEveryone who had ever even known about the project burst into cheers, shouts. “Glory!” They cried, “Tacenie!” “Glory!” “Tacenie!”.\n\nThe Emperor, though, did not cheer – instead, he stood still, thinking. He had one last decision to make. Tacenie had risen – but it was not destined to rule the skies. Its not as if it could, after all – the world had the knowledge to raise it to the skies, but not to keep it there. No, Tacenie’s destiny was to fall, and with its destruction signal the decisive end of the Cycle of Glory. All that was left was for the Emperor to decide where exactly that would happen."

High Lorentish noble and Low Lorentish farmer were moved from their work by the sight of a mountain moving through the sky. Some knew what it was immediately, having studied their history well enough – but it was only when the mages of the Windtower saw Tacenie on approach that Cannor awoke to what was happening.\n\nThey awoke too late. By the time Tacenie arrived above Anbenncóst, the Imperial family had fled – but most simply stood, staring at the flying city above. Men, women, children, of every race, every background, left their homes to watch and marvel, from Wesdam to Varivar. Tacenie climbed higher and higher, until it breached the clouds themselves.\n\nThen, it stopped climbing – for a moment it stood as still as the millions watching. Then the force of its ascent reversed entirely. It’s fall was powered for but a moment – the last dregs of energy either drained, or turned to fuelling the awaiting cataclysm – but it was enough. When Tacenie struck the earth, it was like the Day of Ashen Skies come again.\n\nNot as powerful, of course – but that was small comfort to those within its reach. Anbenncost was utterly annihilated in an instant. Twenty miles outside the city, person and building were simply incinerated, turned to ash by roiling clouds of smoke and fire and debris. Fifty miles, and they were simply flayed instead, or buried alive by their collapsing homes.\n\nThe destruction reached the shores of the Dameshead. Coastal cities were wiped away by apocalyptic floods, while meteors struck those inland like missiles. The death toll reached ten million by the end of the day – then, the ash storms began.

But some Harimari philosophers, having studied the High Temples for years, recognised the architecture – finally connected the dots.\n\nTacenie arrived to a Sramaya confused, out of the loop. People of every race and background, left their homes to marvel at the city in the sky. Tacenie climbed higher and higher, until it breached the clouds themselves. The watchers gasped as a dragon of brass broke through Sramaya – left broken buildings in its wake, as it flew higher and higher. The dragon – the city’s protector, once a shadow, a murmur – roared, jets of flame scorching Tacenie’s back. For some, for a moment, centuries of baseless suspicions were proved true. None lived long enough to share that confirmation.\n\nThe force of Tacenie’s ascent reversed entirely. It’s fall was powered for but a moment – the last dregs of energy either drained, or turned to fuelling the awaiting cataclysm – but it was enough.

 taychendi_empire_events.505.d: "Aboard the flagship of a fleet in the western Divenhal, the great warlords of Taychend stood aboard a warded deck, the Emperor of Taychend at their head, watching. They had prepared for a feast – a celebration. Denariatam saw the explosion in the distance, as it consumed the lives of millions. The ash fell – the ward above shimmered – and those below stood and cheered. They cheered for their Empire, their cheered for their Emperor, their cheered for the turning of the Cycle.\n\nThe Emperor turned back to his warlords, his lieutenants, his family. “Nearly two millennium ago, a similar explosion once ended our world as we knew it. The ordered rule of the Slaver-Nobles gave way to the chaos of the post apocalypse – and the rule of the warlords, and the rule of glory.” He surveyed the crowd before him – saw those descended from the greatest heroes of this past cycle. “But all cycles are destined to end – and their rulers destined to be overthrown.”\n\nDenariatam drew his sabre, held it aloft. “With this sword, this Empire succeeded where every warlord empire before it had failed. We brought the warlords of Taychends to heel, and then led you all to untold riches, unrivalled glory! Our armies scoured Aelantir, the Lizardfolk, Insyaa. We proved time and time again that we were the equal of the Slaver-Nobles and the Empire of Aesadas!” He pointed his sword at the explosion behind him. “And with this final act, we have proven that we have surpassed them!”\n\n“Some of you will return to Aelantir, continue raising the magnificence of our cities, our works. Some of you will sail on, to conquer the wastes left in our wake! But as you build, and grow, and march, and spill the blood of the world, know that the Empire you are building will not fall like those of this cycle. Know that this Empire will soar for millenia! We shall rise above Ducaniel and Arethon, above Ebenanth and Yodhan, Ultarlan and Olhokar, Erankar and Laskaris! On the first year of this new calendar, Taychend shall rise above, alone, the unconquerable masters of this new Cycle…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.505.a: "“...And there we shall rule – an Empire Vainglorious!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.506.t: "Second Thoughts"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.d: "The assembled warlords raised an eyebrow as the Emperor stalled. “I just…” the Emperor paused, chose his words carefully. “I just want to know the exact reasons. For my speech, later.”\nA high ranking warlord raised his voice. “Well… it would mark the definitive end of the cycle of Glory. Show that we’ve surpassed those who came before… both in this cycle and the last. Destroying the last embers of the Precursor Empire.”\nThe Emperor turned to him. “While ruining swathes of our conquests in the process?”\nThe warlord shrugged. “So what? We have not been lenient before.”\n\nThe two stared each other down for a moment. The room grew tenser – then one of the Mudaliar cousins cut through it. “We have shaken off most of Tacenie’s legacy… but it was once the home of our founder. Are we really an Empire that wipes away the legacy of those who came before? We have not gone hunting for the dragons as the Slaver-Nobles, have we?”\n\n“And the Slaver-Nobles and their dragon hunts?” Another warlord called. “What of them?”\n“Have we copied everything from the Slaver Nobles?” The Mudaliar shot back. “I don’t think we spend most of our times on useless pursuits–”\nA Cennayakuta noble in the crowd drew his sabre. “Says you, scion of Tacenie! Why deny us our glory at this most pivotal hour?!”\n\nThe Emperor stepped in, raised his arms – the crowd fell silent instantly. If he allowed Tacenie to fall, signal the new age through destruction and devastation, would he not be giving in to the worst impulses of this current cycle? And falling prey to the weaknesses of the old? Would it really be looking forwards, or looking back? Were they really ending the cycle… or just bringing its excesses to new heights? "
 taychendi_empire_events.506.a: "“Tacenie shall fall, no matter our compunctions. Anbenncóst will be our target.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.b: "“Tacenie shall fall, no matter our compunctions. Sramaya will be our target.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.c: "“Tacenie will not fall… not today.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.507.t: "Year One"
 taychendi_empire_events.507.d: "The room fell into chaos, shouting, scuffling. Sabres were drawn. The Emperor cried “HEAR MY VOICE–!” and the warlords calmed for a moment, stepped back – but their swords were not sheathed. Wrathful faces stared back at Denariatam.\n\n“For too long, our quest for glory has driven us insane! When you look at this wanton destruction, annihilation – does that look like an Empire about to change the world turn a page into a new world, a new cycle?! Or does it feel like an Empire succumbing to its thirst for blood – for glory?! That desire, that hunger– its taken us to the ends of the world and the peaks of the past. But the changing of a cycle, it isn’t about being better than those who came before, it’s about being different!”\n\nThe mood lightened ever so slightly. The Emperor pointed to the projection of Tacenie. “When Aesadas fell, it ended the cycle because it ended the world as it was! I know what you all think– Tacenie’s fall will herald our ultimate victory, be the point where our global domination is guaranteed! And maybe it will be! But if this is a cycle of glory, destroying the world for more glory will not end it, but perpetuate it! And the world will not be ordered, and the cycle ended, by our empire, but by its demise!”\n\nThe tension broke – warlords sheathed their sabres, and Denariatam looked to Tacenie once more as they gave up. “If Ducaniel had made this decision, his cycle would have continued another ten-thousand years.” Then he turned to the warlords. “But we have proven ourselves wiser than him, and more glorious than him! So go! Go back to your cities, to your armies– go back and be proud of what we have accomplished! And when we build again, march again? Do it for order, not chaotic glory!”\n\nHe called for a mage to shut the projection of Tacenie off – though he knew it would not disable the city itself. His descendants could very well fall prey to that which had built their empire. But if his hopes proved true, then this would truly be the first year of a new era, a new cycle…"
 taychendi_empire_events.507.a: "…ruled not by an Empire Vainglorious, but an Empire Transcendant."

 taychendi_empire_events.508.t: "From You, $YEAR$ Years Ago"
 taychendi_empire_events.508.d: "Swing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of sharp iron in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize cut down, like clockwork. He did not even pause to move a stray bang of black hair out of his face. It was hard work, boring work, tiring work – but it was work he was good at. He’d be whipped for not being good at it, after all – he’d needed to be.\n\nToday, the sun was beating down on them. The air was hot and dry – though the sweat made the wrought-iron collar around the slave’s neck a little less uncomfortable, it was small consolation. Only the overseer’s whistle could give that. When it blew, the slave stood, stowed his scythe, and helped the others bring the corn stalks back to the carts.\n\nThe slaves kept their break in the shadow of their master’s statue. It towered over the field – gave them a little shade at certain points of the day, like a sun-dial. A constant yet temporary respite, given at the same time each day for the past 17 years of the slave’s life, just like the break he received half way through the day.\n\nHe looked up to the statue, for a moment – to the elf who owned him – then to the base, built of different stone. A statue of a different, immortal master had once stood where he did – a reminder that the cycle-clock of the world had once been broken. But the Slaver-Nobles were but a memory, now, fallen and faded.\n\nSwing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of sharp iron in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize as he cut it down, like clockwork. This time, though, something did give him pause – an extraordinary shadow. The slave looked up to see an airship sailing across the sky – his warlord, returning from some venture. He wondered, for a moment, if the warlords would fall, just as their predecessors once did."
 taychendi_empire_events.508.a: "Then he bowed down, and returned to his work."

 #Government Reforms
 taychend_warlord_empire: "Warlord Empire"
 taychend_warlord_empire_desc: "The empire of the Taychendi is an one of a complex hierarchy of warlords, who rule from city-states of varying sizes. Though warlords compete amongst similarly ranked compatriots through Periyodhai, a single, unified Emperor – the commander of all military forces – has secured their ruler at the top of the hierarchy.\n\nPrevented from seizing power from within, the warlords therefore seek glory – some say Vainglory – through the conquest of lands outside Taychend, which is then brought back to their holdings."
 taychend_tailatam_system_reform: "The Tailatam System"
 taychend_tailatam_system_reform_desc: "The Tailatam System originated as a method of governance instituted by Tailatam Sangamar in the latter stages of the Gophiran Empire. In order to secure his hold over the Kalavend, he called all warlords within his territory to personally kneel before him, separating his loyal and disloyal subjects.\n\nNow institutionalised, the modern Tailatam System forces all new warlords of a certain stature to submit to the Emperor in person, on pain of death – seeing the grandeur of the capital and Imperial Power, any potentially treacherous ambitions can be seen off."
 taychend_mudaliar_system_reform: "The Mudaliar System"
 taychend_mudaliar_system_reform_desc: "The Mudaliar System originated in the practices of the classical Mudaliar Empire’s rulers. Rather than interfering with the warlords, meddling in their affairs and attempting to cut one down to size, they took a hands-off approach to their subjects, allowing the natural jealousies and ambitions of the warlords’ peers to deal with troublesome upstarts.\n\nNow institutionalised, the Mudaliar System provides a framework in which conflicts between warlords can be both cultivated and controlled, allowing warlords to both accumulate power while ensuring their rivals have a way to keep them in check."

Artifice powered by prismatic damestear is chaotic but powerful, susceptible to the same periodic shifts in both safety and magical potency that normal wild magic is.

Having slain the living jungle, it is believed that these monsters – and the massive plants they fed on – were not entirely artificial. Through a variety of time-consuming methods, we have managed to isolate stimulants we believe play a role in muscle and plant growth – by introducing these to crops and livestock, we can supercharge our agricultural production."
 artifice_invention_taychend_imitation_seedthralls: "Imitation-Seethralls"
 artifice_invention_taychend_imitation_seedthralls_desc: "The Effelai was able to seize the bodies of the Effelai’s inhabitants, turning them into seemingly undead “Seedthralls” and controlling them via spores. Though we cannot replicate the Effelai’s exact method of creating them, we can use the contained remnants of the singing jungle for that purpose, then use replicated spores and artificially produced songs to control them ourselves. By using growth stimulants also sourced from the jungle, these imitation Seedthralls can be used as unstoppable shock troops on the battlefield."
 artifice_invention_taychend_artifice_augmented_kotakompu: "Artifice-Augmented Kotakompu"
 artifice_invention_taychend_artifice_augmented_kotakompu_desc: "Kotakompu – hound-sized, sickle-toothed rats common to Taychend – have extremely durable bodies, which are far more receptive to bio-artifice augmentation than those of elves or men. Grafted steel plates, bionic limbs, spell-casting eyes… there seems to be no limit to what the Kotakompu can accept."

 artifice_invention_taychend_relic_lord_prototype_power_armour_desc: "Since the Warlord-Emperor Yodhan’s day, warriors across Taychend have sought to replicate both his might and style of fighting. In emulation of the Armour of Yodhan, the Emperor’s relic, the Yodhanpir wore heavy, hulking armour – but it could not give them his strength or durability. Artificery, however, can solve that problem. By cladding an damestear-powered exo-skeleton in salvaged plates of Precursor steel, we can deploy true dreadnoughts on the battlefield, each warrior a relic-lord."

The proliferation of the Imperial Cult is now an important part of reinforcing the Emperor’s authority across the Empire.\n\nWhile Taychendi religion is not a proselytising one per se, forcing new subjects to give sacrifices to the Imperial Cult is an important mark of “conversion,” and the Cult has become a key player in expanding Taychendi religious practices to new lands."

While most know her to obviously be a Vampire, Mihaela-Veliara’s administration maintains the fiction that she is, in fact, a Great Relic-Lord, whose blatantly vampiric powers had been granted by powerful blood-magic relics.\n\nIn order to make nice with outside powers, Mihaela also exports significant quantities of relics – a fact that has convinced many outside regimes to publicly accept that fiction rather than risk their supply.
