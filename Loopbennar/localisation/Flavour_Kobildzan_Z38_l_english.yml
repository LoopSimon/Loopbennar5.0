All the new recruits do, and this one was a sorcerer, so of course she was arrogant. But she did something interesting, unique. Damestear had empowered her, so she used her fire-breath all over some flamefungi. Usually, that’d just get it to spew fire in return. She’d done something to it, though. ‘Made it magically receptive,’ she said. ‘Like the gnomes do with glass and iron.’ It absorbed the fire-breath, and then, when she triggered the fungus’s natural defenses later... it spewed fire like nothing I’d ever seen. Like some kind of naturalist enchantment. (Is that what herbology is? Not sure.)\n\nShe’s not the only one, either. We’re learning a lot from the locals, even if they’re scared of us.

Generations ago, not long after the Dragonwake, this had been kobold territory; years of fighting, though, had displaced her people, sending them all south towards the Bluescales. As she digs through the rubble, she finds evidence of old settlements– long-decayed traps and bones of the fallen– and finally feels at home.\n\nA younger kobold approaches her, asking if they'll be settling permanently. "It's so out of the way," he complains; "there's nothing for us here, besides farms no one cares about." Etu chides the child, informing him of their trivu's history, of the importance of home, and the need to make the whole coastline their own. After a long argument ensues, the young kobold asks: "But what about the local Moormen?"\n\n"Moormen? Ha!" Etu responds, already laughing at her own terrible joke. "More like Lessmen!""

Orders precede the gold, laying the path and directing its travel. Meanwhile, dragon-priests and artificers order the creation of a thousand fungal farms, each attempting to prove themselves the greatest stewards of the nation. Experiments procure the best spores and funnel them to the tunnels, while priests preach to the masses while they survey the soil. For both, the motive is the same: prove that they, not the other, can feed the masses of [Root.GetName].\n\nAs tribal barriers merge into coalitions of priests and inventors, each organism of the state creates their own plans for its wealth. None, though, can command that wealth alone; the familial trivuak are the custodians of the caverns, and all governance must eventually flow through their leaders. Contracts are formed between trivu and faction, solidifying the legitimacy of each as the nation becomes one.

Little kobold rowboats and fishing lines had provided sustenance for countless generations, and Virtanen expected to do the same thing his ancestors had always done.\n\nSince the Coast was unified, though, things had changed. Bigger boats had caught more at once; more kobolds than ever were out on the seas; and meanwhile, the gnomes were still fishing, too. Soon enough, there was barely any fish to go around. Soon enough, Virtanen was going hungry.\n\n[Root.Capital.GetName], though, had sent out aid. The kobold fishing vessels they had so recently helped fund were being docked... permanently. In their place, artificers were handing out spores everywhere they went. These new spores, Virtanen was assured, could grow even in sunlight; they could use the fertile lands of the Dragondowns, and grow food like never before.\n\nVirtanen didn't like the change of pace, but he did like having food.

In recent years, this process of "enclosure" has become an official policy of [Root.GetName]: Each trivu is given its own designated lands, and these lands are delineated by traps. The land is then divided, and recorded, by census.\n\nWithin these enclosures, kobolds experiment with new types of cloth, soon to be known as "Koboldquilt." The rivers of the Coast power watermills, each fulling wool into cleaner, pliable forms; then, kobolds apply fungal dyes, making a nacreous rainbow of colors rarely seen outside Viswall; finally, the tiny, dextrous hands of the kobold make sewing easier than it could be for any human.

They weigh it down while filling its mouth, forcing its jaws open and packing them with poison. The Hullbreaker is rendered immobile, captured by the very quarry it wished to destroy.\n\nThe kobolds arrive soon afterwards, piercing the monster's body with electrified harpoons and blasting it to pieces with elemental cannons. To these victors go the spoils of a trap well-laid: ivory teeth for magical wiring, bountiful flesh which could feed an empire, and oil to keep lamps lit all the way to the Dragondepths.

She was pleasantly surprised that the Gerudians seemed to hold a great deal of reverence for dragons: or, at least, for Elkaesal, the great white dragon of the north. The skalds sang endlessly about her power and her majesty; how she could freeze the entire continent, simply by lifting a wing or taking a breath. It reminded the kobold of stories of Malliath, that unknowable power which would one day wake and claim the world for his kin.\n\nEventually, the kobold asks a skald, "Do you believe Elkaesal shall soon wake?" and he responds with a horrified retort of "I surely hope not." It was only at this point that she realized she had been deluding herself. All the great invocations of Elkaesal’s power were warnings, not prayers; the songs were meant to make her sleep, not wake her up.\n\nWho could know of the might and majesty of a dragon without being filled with reverent awe?

Marble statues of the kobold form are raised, each functioning as a shrine to the body rather than to the dragons. Manifestos against Tayekan's absence and Nimrith's greed are read publicly, with each colonist giggling in glee at the freedom. Metal is grafted onto bodies, in places where it never had been before; kobolds become larger, shorter, wider, and thinner. Flesh becomes an experiment, and the mind a meeting-hall.\n\nThis ship is one of dozens which set sail for Haraf, in search of a better home far away from Kobildzan. They clamor for Zurzumex, for the Gommo, even for the goblins of Mestikardu; they seek a place of artificed freedom, far away from the watchful eyes of the dragon-priests. They embrace the Thought, and leave the dragons in their backwash. As long as Kobildzan allows a safe haven to exist for them, they will continue migrating to Aelantir. "

Relying on Gommo connections which stretch a thousand years into the past, the previous divisions within the gnomes– the struggles between Cliff vs. Creek, and of state vs. Gommo– have fallen to the wayside. In their place, two camps of gnomes have emerged: those who embrace us and the dragons, and those who hold fast to the Thought and the Thought alone.\n\nEven the latter group, though, still has connections with our people. They study the dragons, but do not worship them; they find potential in Ascension, even if they do not desire it exactly how we do. In Haraf, they consort with goblins and kobolds alike, finding collaborators (and rivals) in Zurzumexia and Mestikardu.

Now, it seems, as Kobildzan has annexed the gnomes and their artificery, these factions have found themselves in the kobold halls of power.\n\nTo the new elites of Kobildzan, each faction presents an opportunity. The Brillites promise to bring kobolds towards draconic ascension; the Techno-Thaumaturges have gotten along surprisingly well with the dragon-priests; the Mechanists have already taken root in trapmaker workshops and army garrisons across the empire.

He lays a finger on a seal depicting his father, and raises it to eye level; then, he glances to the kobolds, comparing their scales in the light.

Few notice the cracks in the earth apart from the prophets, who interpret the tremors as their father come to wake.\n\nThe second quake comes with waves of humans, gnomes, and goblins, each passing through the gates of Revernaki and progressing towards the Hoard. Clanbosses mingle with scholars, who sing alongside dragon-priests; each sports some draconic alteration, and huddles with excited whispers as the earth grows louder. Some caverns experience collapse, and even a few trivuak burrows are destroyed: but a few displaced kobolds cannot temper the excitement in the air. If Malliath is to wake, the earth certainly might change alongside him.\n\nThe third quake roars as the masses reach Soxun Kobildzex, with tens of thousands of people packed into tiny, cramped caverns. The passageways have never seen this level of density before; the platforms begin to collapse, and volcanic gases choke the faithful. Those who had already made it to the Hoard peer over the edge of its crater, which seems to bulge upwards with growing force.\n\nThe fourth quake rocks Kobildzan to its foundations. Cracks open underneath the Hoard, and geysers of magma shoot upwards. The Hoard itself– full of people, pilgrims, ideas, and wealth, the product of a thousand years of kobold civilization– finds itself devastatingly close to dragonfire."

It breaks through layers of rock, each becoming a projectile, each pushed so quickly upwards that they crumple together into superheated clumps. Even the Dragonheights are not safe: the peak of the mountain above the Hoard pops open like a cork, then crumples into the growing mass of stone and flame.\n\nClose to the earth, large pieces of pumice and tuff collapse onto the mountainsides. These stones are pulverized into avalanches of dust and heat, mixing with broiling air and toxic fumes. The lucky settlements are those who are eradicated immediately by the falling volcanic rocks; the less-lucky are those who can watch their doom coming, as waves of ash and gas roll toward their homes. By the time these flows reach [184.GetName], [167.GetName], and [213.GetName], everything in their path has been destroyed.\n\nFurther in the air, Hoard-gold breaks apart to form tiny flakes of ash, spread by wind and force, blocking out the sun for hundreds of miles in each direction. Western Cannor is covered in darkness: and as the ash falls, it blankets entire cities. Noxious fumes and burning embers sentence many to an ashen grave - the flecks of gold provide little consolation.\n\nBetween the earthen avalanche and the blanket of darkness, a cloud of smoke can be seen for miles. It reaches upwards in a narrow column, then extends and expands into a flat, wide top. Malliath's triumph is as visible as anyone could have imagined it.\n\nIn endless mercy, Malliath has spared his most faithful, who live below the surface and worship his name.

At first it had seemed like a mere logistical failure. As the months went on, though, and the seas stayed silent, worry spread through the Ynn. Varlengeilt even personally reached out to the representatives in Malliahea, but they, too, knew nothing of what had occurred. The silence grew louder by the day.\n\nBy the time a single steam of ships had finally arrived with news– they came from Gerudia, not the Dragon Coast, and spoke of the great blot in the sky which had seemingly wiped out Kobildzan– Varlengeilt had already flown into action. The kobolds may not be Rzentur, but they had become his people, and they had done so much for him. They had created a Dominion in his name, and merely asked to serve. In their time of need, he could not bring himself to defer responsibility.\n\nVarlengeilt raised a fleet in the Broken Sea, filled it with supplies and Ynnic grain, and sent it towards the Dragon Coast with haste. Then, he flew ahead of it, to survey the damage for himself. As he nears the coast and spies the devastation, he knows one thing for certain: he alone will not be able to save this place, to undo whatever has been done.

The blood of his old kobold body splatters on the ground, no longer needed to be maintained. A dragon stands in its stead, and he unfurls his wings.\n\nTayekan flies to Revernaki, the mouth of the caverns where he once revealed the world to the kobolds (and the kobolds to the world). He roars to announce himself, then he descends, and begins digging at the ash with claws faster than any artificed excavator could ever wish to have. He finds the Dragonmarks– the ancient residue of his claws which once heralded him breaking his way to the surface– and lays his palms upon them, just for a few seconds. He remembers what it felt like, in that day of frenzy, when he began tipping the dominoes which led to this moment. Then, he begins to shrink.\n\nTayekan's features condense themselves, turning liquid as they compact into impossibly-small shapes. They rush into a single point, which then expands into the body of a single blue-scaled kobold. Clothes are fabricated from thin air, and soon, Tayekan is a humanoid once more.\n\nHe looks at the assembled crowds, then takes a blueprint out of a bag that had already been laying by the Dragonmarks.

We don't need biological firebreathers when the metal ones will serve us just fine."\n\nOnly slightly louder than the first, the second doctor responds. "I should stab you for that. First, to breathe fire is holy, and I ask that you not blaspheme in front of a dragon. Second, how many forges could be created if we did not need fuel? How much iron could we smelt in a day without the need for coal or wood? There are more uses for dragonfire than just torching soldiers… think of what Kobildzan could be!!"\n\nGlaring at the second for failing to stay quiet, the first doctor replies.

Many have died under its power, but many, too, have been strengthened by its mutations: whether it improves one's life or ruins it seems to be a roll of the dice... or perhaps, instead, the choice of the divine. Either way, its consequences are life-changing.\n\nThe cancer has been successfully quarantined in a singular laboratory, but all of Kobildzan watches and it does its work. Many have called for its destruction, and a full burning of its source laboratory. Such a disease, they say, threatens to destroy Kobildzan if it is not contained; it is impossible to know how fully it would destroy people's lives, nor how it could render entire bodies into new and foreign forms. With so much effort having been spent on turning kobolds into dragons, on changing their forms in particular ways, it would be a waste to allow such an unknown agent change people's bodies at will.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a non-insignificant sect of the population who sees this cancer as a gift from the dragons. Until now, changes to the body had to be purposeful: years and decades went towards every new invention, every new way to transcend the limitations of flesh. Here, though, Kobildzan has an opportunity to try something new. If the disease was to be used in experiments, perhaps it could herald a new age of ascension.\n\nHow does Kobildzan choose to treat the cancer?"

 flavour_kobildzan.22.t: "The Dragon Queens"
 flavour_kobildzan.22.d: "Flaymistrex Draheann decamps from her stage, immediately storming to her chambers and grabbing a pen in anger. "This is disastrous," she groans, as an attendant takes off her spiked wig and claw-cap nails. She begins penning a letter to the capital, full of righteous wrath.\n\n"To the Council in [Root.Capital.GetName],\n\nThe art of the Drag Monarch is one that has been the backdrop of kobold theatre for generations. From the times long before Kobildzan– long before our current splendor– the dragon-priests have sought to teach the masses, and so they have taken to performance. In the plays of our past, so many would act as the foolish and young kobold, while one great priest would take the role of a dragon. This role, heretofore known as the 'Dragon Monarch' (often shortened to Drag Monarch, Drag Queen, Drag King, etcetera), became a staple of kobold learning: and of kobold virtue. They spoke of the necessities of contributing to the Hoard, of honoring the dragons, and of making ourselves greater through family and tradition.\n\nDrag is an art which still prospers, my technocrats: but it is in danger. While Ascension has allowed the Queens great flexibility in how we practice our art (for never before have we been able to fly above the audience, or grow our claws, or breathe fire upon the simulated unworthy), it has also empowered the unfaithful within our midst. I write to tell you I have seen sin within performances! Performers breathing fire not to teach, but simply to entertain; Queens who tell tales of sinful kobolds, lauding kobolds who rejected the dragons or who find enlightenment elsewhere.\n\nYou, my dragons, must put a stop to this. Please, for the art of Drag, and for the soul of Kobildzan, ensure that Drag retains its holy and righteous character!""

 flavour_kobildzan.23.t: "Ascending to Greed"
 flavour_kobildzan.23.d: "One of our head researchers, a dragon-priest and artificer, has gone rogue. He insists that we lack one of the most notable draconic traits– that of greed– and that if we are ever to shed our status as "kobolds" rather than "dragons," we must, too, hoard for ourselves.\n\nTo achieve this, he has stolen mass quantities of artificed research and money. He is constantly experimenting on himself, siphoning massive resources towards himself to achieve ever-greater rewards. He insists that his research– on turning himself into the greatest, most powerful kobold alive– will allow us all to follow his steps, but many are unsure. Can we really trust the self-proclaimed "Prophet of Greed" to help us in the end?"
 flavour_kobildzan.23.a: "Send in the army, he must be crushed!"
 flavour_kobildzan.23.b: "We embrace the Cult of Greed!"
 flavour_kobildzan.23.c: "Divert our spies to steal his research!"
 flavour_kobildzan.24.t: "The Chosen Several"
 flavour_kobildzan.24.d: "Perched on one of the lower peaks of Revernaki, supported by claws the size of a griffon's, a kobold preaches with rage as red as her scales. "We live in an abundance denied," she begins. "The dragons meant for us to become them, and yet we languish: we see our 'Dragons'– the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rest of the technocrats, flying above our heads– and witness what we could easily become. They have always justified their exclusivity, both of their Ascensions and of the term 'Dragon,' by scarcity. The state, they say, cannot afford to bring everyone into the fully draconic; they have not the resources, nor the desire. They say it would be a waste to serve us, to let us become like them. They are liars."\n\nUnderneath the city, a professor scratches her claws into a black fungal wallpaper. The mushrooms recede in splotches of perfectly-aligned colors, creating temporary diagrams which will disperse within an hour. "If everyone is a dragon, no one is! Truly, it's simple as that. We could waste our entire treasury on Ascending everyone and their trivu, but then we would be bankrupt and in anarchy. In Kobildzan, the pious and intelligent rule: our technocrats, officers, and dragon-priests have proven their merit, and so they are allowed to become dragons. For their mental fortitude, they are given the permission required to physically ascend. If everyone was allowed unrestricted access to biological ascension... can you imagine the consequences? How many would perish from faulty, self-inflicted experiments? How many would believe themselves rulers, when they could not even die correctly?"\n\nThis argument plays out in parallel all across Kobildzan. Rarely do the two sides speak; rarer do they agree. The people call out for everyone to be a dragon, and yet, too, for only the ruling class to be fully draconic. A choice must be made on the future of Kobildzani artificery."

Other members of their trivuak, featuring goblins and halflings, each help take care of the eggs and ensure they're safe.\n\nFamilies like these spread across [biocompatibility_province.GetName], the newest in a line of places implementing biocompatibility technologies. Now, for the first time, all species can intermingle and become one. Now, the lines between species blur entirely..."

 kobold_viraxia: "Kobold Viraxia"
 kobold_viraxia_desc: "Due to the fact that kobolds lay eggs and have relatively little gender dimorphism, kobold families grow extremely large and specialized. At the smallest level of kobold society is the "zendia," a familial grouping that ranges from around 15 to 100 people. The next level is the "trivu," a zendia-of-zendia which allows for greater social divisions. Within trivuak, zendiak tend to take on specializations (farming, mining, childrearing, etc.), with entire families working towards one singular purpose.\n\nThe highest level of kobold societal specialization, the "Viraxia," is a translation of the gnomish "Hierarchy." The Greenscale, Bluescale, and Redscale Viraxiak are relatively-recent inventions in kobold society, each having been made in only the past 400 years. Together, they have allowed for far more divisions of labor, culture, and scale within kobold populations."

In some ways, this leads to the field of invention and religion becoming one; in others, the rivalries between the two are fierce and contested.
