 B47_southern_heartland_desc:0 "After these first decades filled with constant strife against marauding bands of orcs and goblins, to say nothing of unscrupulous sellswords, we have finally managed to carve out a safe haven for our people. Joining us are the remnants of the Escanni populace, those loyal souls who didn’t abandon their devastated homeland for refuge in the western realms. Vernham will serve the beating heart of our realm, from which we will embark on a new beginning for Escann. But securing Vernham was merely the first step; many amongst our ranks clamor for further expansion into the unclaimed wastelands left by the Greentide. Most vocal among them are the veteran adventurers of ‘Arturo’s Watch’, who have set their sight on securing the strategic location of the Bladeskeep for our fledgling state."
 B47_bladeskeep_and_the_watch_title:0 "Our Watch begins"
 B47_bladeskeep_and_the_watch_desc:0 "Having secured the Bladeskeep both from orcish warbands and the competing claims of other adventurers, the members of Arturo’s Watch have lost no time in beginning the restoration of the imposing keep, fortifying it against all rival claimants. Their leadership has approached the $MONARCHTITLE$ and the other leaders forming the court of our newly minted realm with an intriguing proposal. They want to form an elite fighting force tasked with the duty to safeguard Stalbór and its peoples from enemies without and within. They envision Arturo’s Watch as part of our overall military forces, not subordinate to the general chain of command but instead accountable only to their Council of Watchers, led by Arturo or his eventual successor and the [leaderTitle] him/herself. If we were to agree to this proposal, we would need a clear and unambiguous agreement between the Watch and our government detailing their duties and the limits of their authority."
 B47_beginnings_of_a_city_title:0 "Rebuilding from the Ashes"
 B47_beginnings_of_a_city_desc:0 "Only the most inveterate optimist would have expected the astonishing revitalisation taking place in the former locations of the city of Vernham and its twin town of Old Vernham. Where until recently only charred ruins and the unburied corpses of their former inhabitants hinted at the formerly vibrant and bustling nature of these settlements, a veritable rebuilding frenzy has gripped both the newcomers planning to build a new life for themselves in the wilderness of Escann, and those former citizens who braved the dangers of a journey back to their former home to restore it to its former glory. With each day, the two settlements appear more like regular towns and less like lonely frontier outposts, but the perimeter of both towns is still cautiously guarded against the dangers of the wilderness beyond."
 B47_deepwood_gateway_title:0 "Unforeseen Encounters"
 B47_deepwood_gateway_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have discovered a hidden passage allowing entry into the deeper parts of the verdant Deepwoods. There they encountered elves unlike any they were familiar with from back home. From what they could deduce, these Wood Elves appear to be descended from moon elven warriors trapped in the Deepwoods during the War of the Sorcerer-King. Their long involuntary exile beneath the shade of the Deepwoods and the recent incursions of orcish warbands during the Greentide, however, has left them distrustful of outsiders. Our best chance to establish amicable relations with our new neighbors might be to enlist the aid of their by now distant moon elven relatives. Let us send out invitations to adventurous elves to come settle in Stalbór."
 B47_deepwood_relations_title:0 "Lion and Oak"
 B47_deepwood_relations_desc:0 "Our persistent efforts to gain the trust of our wood elven neighbors have been successful and our two peoples are increasingly connected by bonds of friendship and trust, with trade flowing freely between our lands. But the wood elves are not the only inhabitants of the verdant depths of this ancient forest. Mirroring the situation in Escann, both goblins and orcs can be found in the groves of the Deepwoods. Spurred on by the capricious desires of the otherworldly entities laying claim to dominion over these woods, both our new elven friends and the other mortal inhabitants of the Deepwoods are locked into a never ending series of futile struggles. Let us attempt to reconcile their differences and find a path to coexistence for all denizens of the Deepwoods."

 B47_the_early_cuirassiers_desc:0 "The wide open plains and gentle hills of southern Castanor from the heartland of Stalbór. It did not take long for horse breeders to utilize these advantageous conditions to establish thriving horse ranches with vast herds of sturdy and quick horses, bred from the remaining stock of tourney horses - once highly valued in chivalric Escann - mixed with prestigious Cannorian lineages. These uniquely Stalbórian horses have proven to be excellent mounts for our cavalry forces. Many of our knights refuse to ride a horse with a different pedigree, and liken the sound of a cavalry charge with these horses to the roar of a lion."
 B47_settle_deepwood_religious_dispute_title:0 "Out of the Forest’s Gloom"
 B47_settle_deepwood_religious_dispute_desc:0 "Bringing not only the wood elves but also the forest goblins and green orcs, each with competing claims on the glades of the Deepwoods, to the table has been no easy task. But by encouraging them to leave behind their superstitious awe regarding the fey infesting the deeper reaches of their forested homeland, or the misplaced admiration for the Dookanson, and instead to join us in devout harmony, a major step towards the unity of all denizens of the Deepwoods has been taken."
 B47_fey_steel_manufacturing_title:0 "Forging Fey Steel"
 B47_fey_steel_manufacturing_desc:0 "One particular trade good reaching our lands from the Deepwoods has caught the attention of Arturo’s Watch: fey steel, forged from iron ore extracted as a side product of the mining effort occurring in the Yfelorr silver mine. While as unyielding as any other steel, fey steel is curiously light, making it ideal for heavy armor. The Watch is eager to set up a branch in the Deepwoods tasked with securing exclusive access to fey steel and turning it into armor for our cuirassiers under the supervision of elven master blacksmiths."
 B47_the_winged_cuirassiers_title:0 "Winged Cuirassiers"
 B47_the_winged_cuirassiers_desc:0 ""The gentlest man cannot live in peace if it does not please his wicked neighbor." This Stalbóri proverb aptly describes the situation at the eve of the Wars of Consolidation in Escann. Where previously unclaimed lands stretched to the horizon, ambitious rulers are now confronted with the harsh truth that to expand their reach means waging war upon their neighbor. Deterring overly covetous neighbors has therefore become of prime importance for Stalbór, and the Winged Cuirassiers are the instrument of deterrence that has convinced many would-be conquerors to seek easier prey for their ambitions. Clad in fey steel armor and mounted upon strong Stalbóri steeds, the thunderous charge of the Winged Cuirassiers recalls the roar of the stone lions emblazoned on their armor."
 B47_regional_security_title:0 "Watchful Peace"
 B47_regional_security_desc:0 "The lands under the sway of Stalbór have been largely pacified, but it is an uneasy peace. The once wide open lands of Escann have been reclaimed by the many realms born from the ambitions of adventurers, exiled nobles and orcish warlords. Now these newborn realms circle each other like starving lions, each waiting for the opportunity to pounce and devour their neighbor. Compounding the issue are the many obscure cults who went with the pioneering settlers not out of a desire to rebuild what was lost in the Greentide, but to evade unwanted attention by the authorities in the west. To ensure the continued existence of Stalbór and keep our hard-won freedoms, our people must be willing to serve in our armies and fend off any attempts to subvert our destiny. Let both foreign enemies and devious cultists taste Stalbórian steel!"
 B47_western_heartland_title:0 "Western Heartlands"
 B47_western_heartland_desc:0 "Where once leaving the immediate vicinity of Vernham meant trading the watchful security of a border settlement for the untamed wilderness of post-Greentide Escann, now our citizens can travel to the foothills of the Godshield mountains or the shores of lake Silvermere, secure in the knowledge that Arturo’s Watch keeps a watchful eye on the roads of the realm and no harm may befall them."
 B47_eastern_heartland_title:0 "Eastern Heartlands"
 B47_eastern_heartland_desc:0 "Following the course of the Silverainé from lake Silvermere all the way to the foothills of the Serpentspine, Stalbór has secured its hold on all lands in southern Castanor between the Deepwoods and the Silverainé. The former dwarven hold of Ânumdihr, long since vacated by its first inhabitants and renamed to Marrhold by the Alenic tribe of the Marrodics, who made it the seat of their stalwart kingdom, has become the crown jewel of eastern Stalbór, with people from all over Stalbór and beyond traveling there in hopes of a new beginning."
 B47_vampires_of_arca_corvus_title:0 "Gateway to Dostanor"
 B47_vampires_of_arca_corvus_desc:0 "Wrestling Arca Corvur out of the grasp of Corvuria’s rulers and securing this strategic locale and ancient testament to the marvels of Castanorian architecture was no easy task. But once in our hands we shall not give it up without a fight. Arturo’s Watch has already made plans to turn the venerable fortress from the seat of power for an oppressive aristocracy into a beacon of liberty for the people of Dostanor. But first the remaining pockets of resistance in the deeper recesses of the sprawling fortress complex will have to be cleared out."
 B47_vampires_of_dostanor_title:0 "Tenebrous Threats"
 B47_vampires_of_dostanor_desc:0 "The discovery of undead fiends infesting the upper reaches of Corvurian society and quite literally draining the peasantry of their lifeblood has come as a profound shock to our people. Many, the members of Arturo’s Watch chief among them, have clamored for a sustained campaign of liberation to free the Corvurians from their vampiric overlords and bring them into the fold of Stalbór. Having secured the lands between Godshield and Daravan’s Folly, the Watch is now engaged in a prolonged campaign of clearing out every last hideout and sanctuary of the undead menace and ensuring that the shadows of the past no longer threaten the bright future of Corvuria’s children."
 B47_the_every_hold_title:0 "The Everyhold" 
 B47_the_every_hold_desc:0 "For many centuries, Marrhold has been known as the ‘Human Hold’, as it alone out of all the holds of hoary Aul-Dwarov has been settled by humans who remade it into their home. But this is no longer fitting, as since Marrhold fell into the hands of Stalbór members of many other races have found a home in the stone halls of Marrhold. With ever more levels of the hold being returned into a habitable state and with the hold now open to all, it’s seeing inhabitants from those that have long lived in the depth of the Serpentspine to those that have never stepped into a world without the open sky. And even some dwarves have returned to the former home of their distant ancestors. Therefore a new, more fitting moniker has gained popularity - the Everyhold, a hold for everyone!"
 B47_the_stalbor_fleet_title:0 "A Stalwart Fleet"
 B47_the_stalbor_fleet_desc:0 "For most of its history, Stalbór has been landlocked, but with our recent expansion into Daravan’s Folly, this is no longer the case. Not only are we now able to participate in the bountiful trade happening all along the shores of the Divenhal, but what until now has only been ominous rumors has become a shameful certainty. The orcish slave trade, abhorrent as it is to our eyes, has not been ended with our dominance over southern Castanor, but still flourishes until this day, with clandestine slave barges traveling down the Dostanesck to be met by unscrupulous slavers from the pirate haven of Nathalaire, who have made a profitable enterprise out of selling on their captive cargo to slave plantations, mines and labor camps all over Halcann and Aelantir. To prevent the continuation of this atrocity and liberate those unfortunates caught in this vile trade we require a powerful fleet capable of hunting down all slavers who dare to enslave our people."
 B47_orc_and_goblin_integration_title:0 "Healing old Wounds"
 B47_orc_and_goblin_integration_desc:0 "While orcs and goblins within our borders have enjoyed the protection of the law the same as any other inhabitant of our lands, provided they were in turn willing to adhere to the laws of Stalbór, ever since the proclamation of the Vernham Homestead Act, the resentments and mistrust caused by the Greentide meant that they tended to congregate in communities set apart from the rest of Stalbórian society. It is long overdue to set aside old grudges and begin healing those old wounds lest they fester. Let us properly integrate our orcish and goblinic neighbors and ensure that all inhabitants of our lands are treated equally."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_title:0 "The Vernham Homestead Act"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_desc:0 "The original Vernham Homestead Act was a piece of legislation that was revolutionary for its time. Granting law-abiding orcs and goblins legal protections against reprisals by vengeful settlers and providing them with a place in society instead of driving them away, was a solution to the task of reconciling conflicting interests of settlers and former members of the Greentide that was unique in post-Greentide Escann. But the provisions in the original act have not kept up well with the changing times and are in dire need of a revision to be a better fit for a flourishing realm that has long since outgrown its pioneering roots. By now orcs and goblins are not the only races aside from humans who populate our lands. By expanding the Vernham act to include elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings we will surely attract many skillful new settlers whose diverse perspectives can only enrich our growing society."
 B47_orc_and_half_orc_soliders_and_generals_title:0 "Tusked Warriors"
 B47_orc_and_half_orc_soliders_and_generals_desc:0 "Unlike many of their compatriots in Escann, the orcs and half-orcs living in our lands were not treated as second class subjects, abused as slaves, driven from their homes or even hunted down like animals. Instead the Vernham Homestead Act enabled a peaceful coexistence. And whether due to natural proclivities or a patriotic sense of duty, many orcs and half-orcs have gravitated towards a life as a career soldier. Steadily rising through the ranks, they have become an integral part of our army and many of our generals possess prominent tusks and a greenish complexion. It is in our best interest to actively support this development and encourage those amongst the settled Dargom orcs who wish to fully integrate into Stalbórian society, and find a way to channel the fierce warrior spirit of the Ozdan orcish nomads into recruitment opportunities for our troops."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_2_title:0 "Monstrosity of Prejudice"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_2_desc:0 "Fuelled by fear, anger and prejudice cloaked in religious dogma, sentient beings of many races have been labeled as ‘monstrous’ for millenia. Whether they are the harpies and gnolls of the sunbaked south or the kobolds and trolls of the frozen north, these races thriving on the edges of Cannorian civilization have long been regarded askance and their cultural practices were considered barbaric. While it can not be refuted that during some time periods and in some lands the traditions and practices of realms populated and ruled by these races have indeed been vile, this should not mean that all members of these races should be painted with the same monstrous brush. All those that want to participate in our new society should enjoy the protections granted by the Vernham Homestead Act."
 B47_vernham_urbanization_title:0 "A New Metropolis"
 B47_vernham_urbanization_desc:0 "The twin cities of Vernham and Old Vernham have risen far above their humble beginnings as frontier outposts erected in the charred ruins of their pre-Greentide predecessors. By now they have started to merge into a continuous metropolis, bustling with inhabitants hailing from all over Halcann. The question on the minds of the government officials responsible for the administration of the capital is whether an attempt should be made to remake Vernham in the image of fallen Castonath and recapture the lost glory of Castanor, or whether Vernham is a new metropolis for a new age with an uniquely Stalbórian essence."

 B47_secure_the_south_desc:0 "Having liberated Corvuria from their parasitic vampire overlords, pacified the gnoll-infested Folly and conquered the coastal lands of Ourdia, southern Escann is now firmly within our grasp and the latest addition to the many lands under our sway. These new lands are however separated from the core of our realm by impassable mountains and inhospitable swamps, leaving their inhabitants vulnerable to the predations of foreign powers. We must ensure that our holdings are properly fortified to deter any opportunistic raider or would-be conqueror. Both the restoration of ancient Castanorian citadels and the construction of new fortifications is needed to secure the south."
 B47_the_great_keep_title:0 "The Great Keep"
 B47_the_great_keep_desc:0 "Over the last decades and centuries our builders have uncovered many secrets of their craft long thought lost by studying the construction of architectural marvels like the Marrhold or the Castanorian Citadels. And they do not rely solely on the discovered practices of the ancients, but have developed innovative solutions for the many issues caused by the reconstruction of entire cities and massive fortifications. It is now time to put that expertise to good use and erect the greatest fortification Escann has ever seen on the former site of the Bladeskeep. May the Great Keep develop an even more exalted reputation than its illustrious predecessor."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_3_title:0 "Friends We Have Yet To Meet"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_3_desc:0 "The rise of Stalbór from mercenary frontier outpost to established empire has been nothing short of meteoric. With our new role as the hegemon of Escann and the discovery of distant lands by intrepid Cannorian explorers, many travelers with unusual features have begun to arrive at our shores. Harimari tigerfolk from the distant east, mutable Lizardfolk from the deep south, far-traveling Centaurs, diligent Hobgoblins, the distant kin of our goblins, sturdy ogres and even the rare Ruinborn, long-lost kin to our elves, and even stranger newcomers from the other side of the world. Let us welcome them, one and all, for Stalbór will always open its doors to those coming with amicable intentions, no matter their origin. All sentients willing to coexist peacefully with each other shall enjoy the same protections and responsibilities under the law."

 B47_the_watch_over_cannor_desc:0 "Arturo’s Watch has been instrumental in guarding Stalbór against enemies from without as well as from within since its founding. But the ambitions of the Watch do not end at the borders of Stalbór. As the Watch has been fiercely protective of its relative independence since its founding many years ago, its leadership has now declared the intention of establishing new Watch chapters far beyond our borders and promote the ideal of peaceful coexistence of all sentient races and protection under the law for all who are willing to abide by it to the rest of Cannor. Let us hope for the sake of all inhabitants of Cannor and beyond that their efforts bear fruit!"
 B47_complete_acceptance_title:0 "Sanctuary for All"
 B47_complete_acceptance_desc:0 "Stalbór may be a realm amongst others, one place of many on the map of Halcann, but more importantly, it is an ideal - the ideal of peaceful coexistence amongst all sentients. We have become a sanctuary for all beings fleeing persecution, prejudice or subjugation simply for the crime of existing. Here in our lands the slate is wiped clean and it is not their race or faith but their own virtues and shortcomings that will determine their fate. It is not an uncommon sight in our cosmopolitan cities to see the gnomish clockmaker setting up shop next to a lizardfolk alchemist, a dwarven smith or a harpy messenger. We are a safe haven for everyone and everyone may have a place amongst our ranks."

 flavor_stalbor.2.d:0 "Ever since Stalbór was founded, the brave men and women of Arturo’s Watch have guarded our people against threats both internal and external. But even these heroes cannot be everywhere at once, and as our realm continues to prosper and grow, the small chapter house of the Watch established in [Root.GetName] will no longer suffice. The province now requires a fully staffed branch of the Watch to ensure its continued safety. It is incumbent on us to decide what the main duties of this latest branch of the Watch shall encompass."

 flavor_stalbor.3.t:0 "Building Bridges"
 flavor_stalbor.3.d:0 "Looking out over the gently rolling plains and verdant woodlands of the lands south of Lake Silvermere, one forgets for a moment the cataclysm which ravaged these lands mere decades ago. Realms with as storied a past as the Blademarches were swept away in the Greentide, leaving only devastation in their wake. The formerly flourishing lands were turned into a desolate wasteland, which until our arrival only roaming bands of orcs and goblins called their home. But not any more!\n\nWith blade in one hand and tools in the other we have reclaimed part of these lands for civilisation, built new homes where only ruins stood, tilled the abandoned fields and paved the way for both those brave souls daring to return to their former homes as well as adventurous wanderers seeking a new beginning in an untamed land. While the original core of our budding nation originates from the southern realm of Busilar, the people gathering under our protection hail from many places, bringing their own unique traditions and foibles with them in this new land. Our duty as their sworn protectors is therefore not only to shield them from predators both sentient and otherwise, but also to settle the inevitable disputes arising between them, mend fences and build bridges between people from disparate backgrounds.\n\nBut we share these lands not only amongst ourselves, but also with the clans of orcs and goblins who once came pouring out of the mountains during the Greentide. While other adventurers might attempt to seek their subjugation or even banishment  in the name of some twisted form of justice or out of a sense of ruthless practicality, we shall not expend our limited strength on such wasteful and ultimately futile endeavors. We shall repel any attempts to drive us away, but these vast lands surely can accommodate all who wish to make them their new home, as long as all sides learn to coexist peacefully.\n\nWe are no longer just an adventuring band, but a newborn state. And in honor of the intrepid pioneers who started the reclamation of our lands and to commemorate our aspiration to build bridges between the many peoples coming to these lands, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been inspired to name our new realm Stalbór, merging the elven word for bridge, bór, and the Stalwart Band whose bravery made all of this possible. True to our chosen name we shall be stalwart bridgebuilders, forging connections even between those who consider themselves mortal enemies."

His sworn followers had soon taken to calling themselves Arturo’s Watch, and saw it as their duty to guard the people of Stalbór. They took up residence in the storied ruins of the Bladeskeep soon after it was claimed by Stalbórian troops. Their leadership has now approached us with a bold proposal. They aim to become Stalbór’s incorruptible wardens, enforcing the laws of the land impartially and protecting all its inhabitants equally, separate from the regular military and accountable only to their council of Watchers and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\n§ROnce you have enacted the Book of Stone you gain the ability to upgrade your Arturo's Watch Chapters on provinces by Expanding Infrastructure in the province.

He is also a profoundly difficult man to work with. In recent years he has harangued the government on multiple occasions, lambasting what he considers their failure to undertake the necessary steps needed to ensure the continued safety of Stalbór. With the rise of would-be-empires on our borders, built on the greed of unscrupulous soldiers of fortune or the twisted ambition of mages eschewing any kind of limit on their arcane experiments, he has long considered Stalbór to be ill-prepared if one of our more malign neighbors were to test our defenses.\n\nNow his frustrations have gotten the better of him, however, and he has risen in open revolt, attempting to overthrow what he considers an ineffectual government and guiding our realm onto a new path. He is not alone in his coup attempt, having gained the support of a number of followers both from within and beyond the Watch. Most crucially, the order of the Blade Stewards have thrown their lot in with Elrac and he has been seen wielding the reforged Gleaming Blade Calindal.

In the end, even wielding Calindal could not save Elrac of Dustandar, former commander of Arturo’s Watch and traitorous would-be usurper. He and his most ardent followers were slain in battle and his conspiracy to claim the crown for himself has been shattered. The hand that dared wield the famed blade Calindal for such unworthy ambitions has been severed at the wrist and displayed prominently in the capital. The sword itself has been seized for the time being and is securely guarded.\n\nThe remainder of the Order of Blade Stewards has approached us to beg forgiveness for their part in Elrac’s rebellion and requested the favor to continue their solemn duty of guarding Calindal until a wielder worthy of the Gleaming Blade is found again. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has granted this request in return for the surrender of the blind masters who showed such blatant bad judgment by allowing Elrac to wield Calindal, so that they may face their just punishment. From now on, Calindal will be kept under close watch behind the strong walls of the Bladeskeep by both the Blade Stewards and those members of Arturo’s Watch who remained loyal."

We wood elves have been desperately trying to stem the tide of belligerent orcs flooding into our glades, with goblins - whether native to these woods or brought from the mountain deeps by the orcish clans - caught in the middle.\n\nBut now a new player has joined the struggle. A human realm called Stalbór, born from a group of hardy warriors and adventurous pioneers who reclaimed the lands beyond the forest devastated by the Greentide, has found one of the hidden pathways that connect our forest home with the outside world. Far from becoming yet another front that our already overextended forces have to hold, however, they may prove our salvation. Initial contacts have been promising, with their traders fascinated by the unique bounty we have learned to harvest from these woods, and their leaders clearly supportive of our struggle against the orcish threat.\n\nAn emissary has now come before our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], promising the strength of their armies in service of our cause, in return for an oath of fealty and the discarding of our faith in the capricious lords and ladies of the feyrealm. While many amongst our ranks are quick to remind the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that we have stood our ground ever since we settled in these woods by the strength of our arms alone, others point out that the tremendous losses we and our kin in the other groves have suffered in the last decades of fighting are unsustainable in the long term."

To avoid unnecessary conflict, efforts have been undertaken to ensure the proper integration of our orcish populace into mainstream Stalbórian society.\n\nMany orcs and half-orcs amongst our people have gravitated towards the life of a soldier, but the upper ranks of our armies have not exactly welcomed them with open arms. This is about to change. One school of thought, favored by the leaders of the settled orcish Dargom communities, prefers a seamless integration of orcish soldiers into our military. Others, the tribal chieftains of the semi-nomadic Ozdan or Freefolk first among them, plead for the creation of separate regiments composed solely of orcs and half-orcs, arguing that their fierce combativeness should not be diluted amongst our regular troops but instead used to shatter the front lines of the enemy.\n\nWe now have to decide which path to follow.

After the peace treaty ceded the fortress and its surrounding countryside to us, the leadership of Arturo’s Watch was quick to petition [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant them the fortress as a central base of operations from which they plan to oversee the new chapters of the Watch that are being founded in our new Dostanorian possessions.\n\nHowever, before we can truly consider this ancient citadel ours, we will have to deploy considerable forces to familiarize ourselves with the twisted layout of this fortress complex, expanded and reshaped over more than a millennium. Innumerable nooks and crannies exist for any remaining assassins, saboteurs, and fighters left behind after the retreat of the Corvurians, which we will need to root out first."
 flavor_stalbor.13.a:0 "A final push will surely clear those last pockets of resistance."

 flavor_stalbor.14.t:0 "Plunging the Depths"
 flavor_stalbor.14.d:0 "Several days have passed since the last of our troops descended into the bowels of Arca Corvur. While at first the command staff stationed in the upper levels of the fortress received steady updates, those reports became more scarce with each passing day. Contact to some of the units exploring the deepest recesses of the citadel was lost completely, and rumors of devastating ambushes made the rounds.\n\nThis nerve-wracking waiting game suddenly came to an end as one of the scouts attached to a regiment exploring the lower basements of the fortress came stumbling out of one of the access stairways, lurching into one of the main courtyards that had been repurposed as our command post. He was covered in blood, and after he had adjusted to the bright light of the sun, he dragged himself to the commanding officers stunned by his sudden disheveled arrival.\n\n’Monsters! Demons straight from the underworld! Bloodsucking fiends!’ Those were the first words out of his mouth. It took quite a bit of effort to calm him down sufficiently for a proper debriefing. It appears that our forces have encountered some malign presence hidden deep within the bowels of this ancient fortification - something that is not quite mortal, and which is eager to drain the lifeblood of our brave soldiers."
 flavor_stalbor.14.a:0 "Let us seek counsel from those more familiar with these fiendish creatures."
 flavor_stalbor.14.b:0 "Whatever they are, they will surely fall to good Stalbórian steel!"

 flavor_stalbor.15.t:0 "A most disturbing Turn of Events"
 flavor_stalbor.15.d:0 "It appears in hindsight that our decision to send more troops down into the blood-drenched innards of Arca Corvur might not have been the wisest course of action. The additional forces were unable to use their numerical advantage in the narrow winding corridors and simply melted away in ambush after ambush, leaving us no closer to clearing out the infestation entrenched deep beneath our feet. It might be time to reconsider our approach."
 flavor_stalbor.15.a:"Like lambs to the slaughter!"

 flavor_stalbor.16.t:0 "The Fiends in the Depths"
 flavor_stalbor.16.d:0 "A senior member of Arturo’s Watch has approached us with a somewhat unorthodox solution to the problem of the monstrous resistance hidden within the catacombs of Bal Dostan. Thanks to her many contacts in the demi-monde of adventurers, sellswords and fortune hunters, she has arranged a meeting with an experienced coterie of monster hunters whom she assures us are more than capable of dealing with whatever evil lurks within the depths of the fortress. They do not come cheap, however, and some of our generals are of the opinion that our coin is better spent elsewhere when our courageous troops are eager to prove their mettle against this new enemy."
 flavor_stalbor.16.a:0 "They better be worth their price!"
 flavor_stalbor.16.b:0 "What can they achieve that our brave soldiers can’t?"

 flavor_stalbor.17.d:0 "The monster hunters we have contracted to deal with the issue of the bloodsucking monsters ensconced within the fortress complex of Arca Corvur have finished their preparations and are ready to descend into the gloomy depths of this ancient citadel. They promise to flush out any of the fiends that have butchered our soldiers. Let us hope they manage what our soldiers have failed to achieve and bring an end to this bloody debacle."
 flavor_stalbor.17.a:0 "Happy hunting!"

 flavor_stalbor.18.t:0 "Dawn rises, Shadows vanish"
 flavor_stalbor.18.d:0 "Finally our anxious wait has ended; our risky gamble with the monster hunters has paid off. With the first rays of dawn, the first of their members emerged from this grueling mission in the lower levels of the fortress. In her grip she held the severed head of one of our intransigent enemies. The rictus grin of the head reveals abnormally sharp and elongated fangs in a face that might otherwise pass as that of a pale, pampered aristocrat.\n\nOver the course of the day more and more of their number climbed up the stairs from the catacombs deep below their feet, carrying with them not only proof of their success in smoking out the last remaining pockets of resistance, but also deeply disturbing documents, artwork and other artifacts that might shine a light on the true nature of the tenebrous adversaries we have faced here.\n\nBut now it is time to celebrate our long overdue victory and begin the transformation of Arca Corvur from a symbol of oppression into a beacon of freedom."
 flavor_stalbor.18.a:0 "Arca Corvur is finally truly ours at last!"

 flavor_stalbor.19.t:0 "The Root of Evil"
 flavor_stalbor.19.d:0 "The evidence gathered in the deepest bowels of Arca Corvur and the confessions extracted from those thralls surviving the demise of their undead masters paint a truly disturbing picture. It appears that the aristocratic rulers of Corvuria have, for the most part, turned their back on their humanity and become undead monstrosities, draining their abused subjects of their blood to prolong their unnatural existence, treating the people entrusted to their care as mere livestock.\n\nAs far as our scholars have been able to tell, the vampiric curse appears to have first emerged in these lands during the time of the Aldresian Crusade. This means that for centuries the people of this benighted domain have suffered at the hands of those who would rather turn into monsters than care for those under their rule.\n\nThis revelation has caused a massive uproar in our ranks, and many demand that we take appropriate action to rescue our brothers and sisters in those parts of Corvuria not yet under our protection."
 flavor_stalbor.19.a:0 "This atrocious state of affairs will not continue if we have anything to say about it!"

 flavor_stalbor.20.t:0 "Leechfinder General"
 flavor_stalbor.20.d:0 "One amongst the number of monster hunters we have gathered to our cause has attracted our attention due to his natural leadership talents. Galin síl Vekt has cleansed more than his fair share of vampire nests and survived to tell the tale, becoming something of an unofficial leader amongst his peers in the process. His fellow vampire trackers have begun to call him ‘Leechfinder General’, partly as an honorific, partly as a well-meaning jest playing on the gradual militarization of their ranks.\n\nWe now have the opportunity to make this title a reality and grant him far reaching authority over the campaign to finally rid Corvuria and its neighbors of the vampiric infestation plaguing these lands. If we want to succeed in liberating the abused people dwelling in the shadowy lands beneath the Godshield mountains from the yoke of the bloodsucking monsters that have oppressed them for centuries, his services will surely prove to be invaluable."
 flavor_stalbor.20.a:0 "Let him lead our forces in the efforts to cleanse Corvuria of these undead abominations."

 flavor_stalbor.21.t:0 "The Grand Purge"
 flavor_stalbor.21.d:0 "The state of affairs in Corvuria is a grotesque perversion of all the ideals Stalbór stands for, and it will not and cannot be tolerated any longer. We have begun to cleanse the lands of ancient Dostanor of these vile sanguivorous parasites, and our experienced trackers have been invaluable in hunting them down, wherever they may attempt to hide.\n\nThe Grand Purge, as it has begun to be called, is however not a complete success, with some of the leeches managing to escape our tightening net and attempting to worm their way into far away lands unaware of the danger they represent, to start their reign of terror anew. Other vampires in their arrogance have decided to resist their just fate and used the influence they wield in their former dominions to incite their thralls and force their oppressed subjects to rise up against us. We have to end these attempts at insurrection unless we want to risk undoing all our hard-won progress. Let us end this once and for all!"
 flavor_stalbor.21.a:0 "The people of Corvuria will be freed, even if they might not appreciate all we have done."

 flavor_stalbor.22.t:0 "We Shall not Relent"
 flavor_stalbor.22.d:0 "Corvuria itself might be freed from the perfidious influence of vampiric monsters, but our advancing forces have not managed to capture all of these fiends during the conquest. Some have managed to escape their just fate and slithered away into neighboring realms, or even farther afield where they mistakenly consider themselves beyond our reach.\n\nIt is now upon us to disabuse them of this notion and hunt them down.Unfortunately we do not possess unlimited resources to dedicate to this just endeavor, which is why a controversial debate has been raging over the last months regarding the question where we should focus the efforts of our seasoned hunters.\n\nMany consider the Borders, containing the easternmost provinces of the Empire of Anbennar and directly bordering the former Corvurian lands, as the most obvious choice. Others suggest that Esmaria with its opulent river parties and pampered aristocrats might be a more attractive destination for those bloodsuckers eager to return to their decadent ways. Another target suggested is the Dameshead, with its thriving cities full of potential victims to sate the hunger of even the most gluttonous of vampires. Some even consider the rich port cities of the Damescrown, capable of satisfying even the most extravagant desires and providing easy access to an unlimited supply of orcish slaves shipped down the Alen river, as the most promising target. Finally, a few voices at court suggest the lands of Lencenor to the far west, where it is rumored that it is not always just red wine that is served at certain revelries.\nWhere shall we begin with our hunt for these undead fugitives?"
 flavor_stalbor.22.a:0 "The Borders are the most logical choice to start our search."

 flavor_stalbor.23.t:0 "The Silken Glove or the Mailed Fist"
 flavor_stalbor.23.d:0 "While the choice of where to focus our efforts for now has been made, there is still a lively debate between our generals and the representatives of the vampire hunters on one side and our diplomatic corps and the trade ministerials on the other. While our diplomats point out that we cannot simply send out squadrons of hunters beyond our borders without securing at least the tacit permission of local rulers unless we want to entertain the risk of serious diplomatic incidents, the hunters make the convincing counterargument that any negotiations taking place prior to their deployment risk tipping off their intended targets.\n\nNow a decision must be made how we shall proceed in this venture - with a silken glove or mailed fist."
 flavor_stalbor.23.a:0 "We cannot risk our prey finding out about our plans - send out the hunters immediately."
 flavor_stalbor.23.b:0 "Best lay the proper groundwork by diplomatic means to ensure the success of our hunters."

 flavor_stalbor.24.d.1:0 "Our hunters have reached their destination and started to recruit local sources, gathering leads in pursuit of their slippery prey. For the longest time, the Borders have had to deal with this tenebrous threat out of their eastern neighbor. It is our duty to ensure that they do not become the unintended victims of our liberation of Corvuria. Imperative now is to decide upon our approach to capturing our prey to prevent failure after we have expended so much time and effort."
 flavor_stalbor.24.d.2:0 "Our hunters have reached their destination and started to recruit local sources, gathering leads in pursuit of their slippery prey.

It is now imperative to decide upon our approach to capturing our prey to prevent failure after we have expended so much time and effort."
 flavor_stalbor.24.d.3:0 "Our hunters have reached their destination and started to recruit local sources, gathering leads in pursuit of their slippery prey. Even in the hustle of the crowded damerian cities, a thirsty bloodsucker can be tracked if one knows what to look for. It is now imperative to decide upon our approach to capturing our prey to prevent failure after we have expended so much time and effort."
 flavor_stalbor.24.d.4:0 "Our hunters have reached their destination and started to recruit local sources, gathering leads in pursuit of their slippery prey.

 flavor_stalbor.24.d.5:0 "Our hunters have reached their destination and started to recruit local sources, gathering leads in pursuit of their slippery prey. We will not rest until they are caught, for otherwise the winelords may turn to a darker sustenance than their famous Rubenaire Red.

 flavor_stalbor.26.d:0 "It was a long and arduous chase, but the last communique of our hunters reports that they are finally closing in on their vampiric prey. While they may have ruffled some feathers in their zealous pursuit of the bloodsucking fugitives trying to escape justice, it was felt that this could not seriously endanger the success of their mission.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that this is exactly what happened. As far as we can tell from the scattered news reaching us in the aftermath of the debacle, the actions of our hunters appear to have alarmed their target, precisely what we wanted to avoid by sending them out without delay. Instead of catching their prey, they were led into a trap, where they attacked several local guards whom they mistook for vampire thralls.\n\nThis has understandably caused a bit of a diplomatic incident now that our involvement has come to light. We need to deal with the fallout and plan our next steps."
 flavor_stalbor.26.a:0 "Our efforts have failed and we must reconsider our approach."

Here the creature will stand trial for its many crimes committed over the centuries and face justice for atrocities perpetrated against the oppressed people of Corvuria. While the result of the trial is a foregone conclusion, given the host of evidence gathered after the liberation of Corvuria, putting them on trial is nonetheless important both for their former victims and any remaining sympathizers still enthralled by their former masters - as well as for those of our subjects who did not experience firsthand the cruelty of these bloodsucking fiends. Those undead abominations will have to learn that even they do not exist beyond justice."

Once they are convinced of the righteousness of our cause and the danger their new ‘guests’ represent, we shall be able to capture the fugitive leeches with the full support of the local government. However, we must decide whether we can afford the time needed to gather all the needed evidence, or if we should instead rely on a shortcut to prevent our target from noticing our presence before we can act."

With the Watch ensuring the equal protection of all inhabitants of Stalbór regardless of their race, origin or creed, they have been instrumental in transforming the desolate wastelands of southern Escann into the thriving realm it is today. By offering shelter to all who are willing to abide by the laws of the land, our country has been settled by people hailing from many different lands and belonging to many disparate races. But the current generation of Watchers have more far reaching ambitions than merely ensuring the proper enforcement of justice for all within the borders of Stalbór. In their view, justice should be granted to all sentients, regardless of their origins, and not just to those residing within Stalbór.

Or is misplaced nostalgia for an age long past detrimental to the goal of crafting a bright future - a future that might very well exceed all the wonders hoary Castanor has raised? Many at court have been swayed by the siren call of Castanor, admiring the wonders of magnificent Castonath even in its current diminished state. Others however have been insistent that the heart of Castanor has been rotten not just since the times of Black Castanor, but since its inception, and all its marvels are merely gilding over the barbarous cruelty at its core - the crimes of Beastbane, who created a lasting rift between all sentients by arbitrarily dividing them into civilized and monstrous races."

 flavor_stalbor.42.d:0 "Hailing from the sun-blessed lands far east beyond the Salahad, the tigerfolk of Rahen have arrived on our shores. Seeking a new home far from the turmoil their homeland is embroiled in. Soon after their arrival, we learned that the reputation of the Harimari as scholars and administrators par excellence is not undeserved. They are an unusual sight, for sure, but everyone willing to deal with the tedium of bureaucracy is more than welcome."
 flavor_stalbor.42.a:0 "Our clerks are ecstatic to have these skilled reinforcements."

 flavor_stalbor.43.t:0 "Denizens of the southern Jungles"
 flavor_stalbor.43.d:0 "With the increasing growth of trade networks all over Halann in the wake of the expeditions to previously unknown shores made by many Cannorian nations in the recent past, sentient beings unheard of in even the most outlandish tales told before this Age of Exploration have found their way to our shores. Among them are the diverse lizardfolk of the southeastern jungles of Sarhal. While varying drastically in appearance between Naga, Ashhama, Tsurin and the many other varieties of their kind, they all consider themselves part of the same greater whole, truly an inspiration for us all. Some of the more adventurous amongst their ranks have found their way to us and begun to settle in the swamps and marshlands of Stalbór, where they are reminded of their former home and find the rare plants used in their famed alchemical potions."
 flavor_stalbor.43.a:0 "Let’s see what wondrous tinctures they will brew."

 flavor_stalbor.44.t:0 "Hunger for Companionship"
 flavor_stalbor.44.d:0 "Another recent addition to the cosmopolitan Stalbórian society are the ogres. Most come seeking a way out of the constantly repeating cycles of gluttony and starvation that grip their austere homelands beyond the Serpentspine, but some of them hailing from even farther origins in the far east or south come for a more spiritual type of nourishment. We are happy to fullfill both needs, as their ogrish strength has turned out to be a valued contribution to our growing industries."
 flavor_stalbor.44.a:0 "Our larders are filled to the brim, let them enjoy the fruits of our companionship."

 flavor_stalbor.45.t:0 "Late Arrivals"
 flavor_stalbor.45.d:0 "Distant cousins to our fellow Stalbórians of elven descent, the ruinborn descend from those amongst the elves who were left behind after the Ruin of Aelantir. Some of the more adventurous amongst them have decided to see for themselves, whether the tales of equality for all within the borders of Stalbór are true. After the first reports of their experiences in our lands had trickled back across the Lament, more and more have decided to brave the journey and come to a place where they are no longer treated as at best second-class citizens by their Cannorian overlords."
 flavor_stalbor.45.a:0 "Stalbór welcomes all!"

 flavor_stalbor.46.t:0 "Honour and Family"
 flavor_stalbor.46.d:0 "Among the more recent newcomers to the Stalbórian melting pot are the hobgoblins of Haless. Whether they were born beneath the mountains, on the plains of northern Rahen or in the arid highlands north of the Jade Mines, they all had to leave their former home and have traveled far in search of a new place to settle down. Arriving with little more than the clothes on their backs, they soon developed a reputation as hard workers, honest and disciplined, and utterly devoted to their families. We are lucky to have them join our ranks."
