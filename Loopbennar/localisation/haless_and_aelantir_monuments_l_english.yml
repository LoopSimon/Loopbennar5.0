fortress_azka_sur_desc: "Long before the age of God-Kings, Azka-Sur was founded as a trade outpost for the dwarven Segbandal alliance. As humans gathered around what was then known as 'Logrod-Tûngr', the dwarves taught the humans the basics of agriculture and law, helping the humans to thrive and prosper and the granaries of the Middle Dwarovar to be filled. After the fall of the Djinns, the city was reorganized around the fortified temple, and continues to defend the people of Azka-Sur from their enemies to this day."

sun_dial_desc: "One of the great wonders of Azka-Sur, the Sun-Dial of Azka-Sur was built long ago by dwarven merchants when the city was still known as Logrod-Tûngr as a more precise way to tell the time of day. While the Sun-Dial fell into disuse when the Segbandal collapsed, it became an object of veneration and a gathering place once the New Sun Cult and Jaher spread into the lands of Azka-Sur."

bazaar_brasan_desc: "While Brasanni merchants are notoriously humble, and will notify any traveler that their bazaar can hardly compare to those of the far east in Haless, in Bulwar there is no competition. no marketplace can rival Brasan in the sheer selection of both ordinary and exotic goods gathered from all around the world into one place."

port_emperor_desc: "It was on the docks of Brasan that Jaher first declared himself the Phoenix Emperor. The great port and the ships within it allowed him to unify much of the eastern world. His daughter Jexis would go on to commission a thousand warships and used them to build an empire of her own. From Brasan, Jexis and her father Jaher filled the sea with ships."

temple_sun_desc: "A long time ago, Darkness reigned in Bulwar as the old gods died. Only the Light of Surakel remained to save its people from damnation and corruption, but the old priests still adored the dead gods and refused to acknowledge that the only salvation could come from the Sun. But in 1150 BA, an hermit emerged from the Salahad desert and gathered followers. He spoke of his visions, of the war between the Gods, the Darkness and the sacrifice Surakel made for his people and his never-ending fight. The old city of Vacyn welcomed Hammura the Wise who became the first kašra (priest) of Surakel and built the first temple, eduz, to his glory, giving a new name to the city.\n\nBulwar may have become the centre of the cult thanks to its huge population, but every true believer knows that the Cult was born in Eduz-Vacyn."

mountain_of_clear_sight_desc: "The Mountain of Clear Sight is where the Divine-herald Jaddar was enlightened by Surael. As the Desert Elven companions that accompanied Jaddar from his earliest return to the desert report, it was in 1333 AA when Jaddar descended from the mountain, now known as the Mountain of Clear Sight. This moment is generally considered the founding date of the Jadd faith."

moon_mountains: "Mountains of the Moon"
moon_mountains_desc: "The Mountains of the Moon are the highest point in Bulwar outside of the Serpentspine. During the days before the New Sun Cult when the old Bulwari gods were worshipped, the Mountains of the Moon were a location venerated for its holiness by both the Bulwari and the Cannorian followers of the Dame, with the most devout individuals attempting to reach the mountain's summit as a pilgrimage. Today with the rise of the New Sun Cult and the worship of Jaher as Surael reborn, the Mountains of the Moon are nearly universally derided by the Elven priests of the New Sun Cult as being heretical in nature, and forbid ascending it."

stone_palace: "Stone Palace of Ekluzagnu"
stone_palace_desc: "An ancient fortress, the Stone Palace of Ekluzagnu served the Tluukt gnollish armies as their first line of defense against attacks by Bulwari humans, though it would ironically eventually become their last line. In 1507 Tluukt's old enemies, the Jaddari, declared the final war against the gnolls in Bulwar. While some traitorous gnolls sided with the elves and accepted the Jadd, the loyal gnolls of Tluukt fought to the last soldier, but despite their ferocity were pushed back all the way into the recently restored Ekluzagnu. Here, the Jaddari led an extremely long and costly siege, fighting floor by floor to kill every single gnoll in the fortress. Ironically, the very same place destroyed by Xhazobine ended up being the site of last stand of gnollish rule in Bulwar."

eranils_oddities: "Eranil's Oddities"
eranils_oddities_desc: "In 1450 AA, the census of Queen Qamara szel-Azanerdu identified more than 200 stalls and shops that plied their trade in the markets of Kalib. But only one is featured in Bulwari folk-tales, only one has its own song, only one can never be found in the same place twice: Eranil's Oddities.\n\nThe store dates back to the Phoenix Empire, and has been run by the eccentric elven craftsman Eranil the Strange for all those centuries. From djinni teeth to vials of Jaher's blood to peculiar variants of Damestear, the goods it sells are unique in all Halann.\n\nIts clientele included merchants and adventurers, pilgrims and scholars, and by the 17th century, even witch-kings' envoys and Ravelian artificers would on occasion seek it out. And for all: if they fail to find what they are looking for at Eranil's shop, well, there are plenty of other merchants quick to hawk their wares."
