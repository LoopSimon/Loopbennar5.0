Joy is such a familiar sensation to them that none of them would even consider betraying our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the lower castes are pacified by their obedience to their betters.\n\nThe pleased philosophers, in fact, have begun to speak of a new school of High Philosophy. In the natural beauty of Van, as the sun shines over a tropical wonderland and birds chirp in perfect unison with the waves, they claim they have found a path to Purtara. In studying and inquiring more into the reasons why nature is as beautiful as it is, in categorisation and classification of the world around us, Kartya is found. The soul's journey to harmony is mirrored by a person's journey through nature. The state, pleased at the emergence of this new school that avoids politics and governance entirely in favour of contemplation of nature's bounty, has graciously funded its expansion. A gilded cage has been forged for High Philosophy; a faith so sublime that no one will ever even consider another way could exist."

With Vandipha's recent conquests, though, halfling slaves have been brought into our grasp, and we have discovered just how skilled they are as gardeners.

 L62_prestigious_slave5:0 "Clad in exotic chains of what the hobgoblins call 'korashi' is a Mengi sorcerer, from a village near the Crater of the Martyr. With a somber face, he explained to our representative that he became a sorcerer through contact with the remains of the Damestear Dragon that lie within the crater, and after accidentally unleashing a firestorm that destroyed most of his village, he became a prisoner of his own free will. He is willing to serve us, but refuses to take place in any conflict."
 L62_prestigious_slave6:0 "A Mengi lord comes before our representative dumbfounded. He explains that in one of his raids, the organiser of the defences of the village was not a native of the village, but rather a…harimari? After vigorous questioning, the harimari said he came from a well-established noble family, but had to flee after a palace coup. Fate has brought him here before us in chains, and his place is beneath us now, but he can still be useful."
 L62_prestigious_slave7:0 "The strange, small, pale figure was initially mistaken for a halfling by the slaver-lord selling him. He introduced himself with an incomprehensible name, and explained that he was a “gnome”, a race from distant Cannor, with the "Gommo", some sort of organisation of gnomish artificers. He views the concept of being sold into slavery as a delightful novelty that will allow him to investigate Vandiphan society, and offers to establish connections between us and the Gommo."

Their hands, calloused by labor, hold great precision; their gaze betrays a knowledge as grand as it is unyielding. Now, their expertise shall become the foundation of our grand designs, their sweat a tribute to the will of their superiors."
